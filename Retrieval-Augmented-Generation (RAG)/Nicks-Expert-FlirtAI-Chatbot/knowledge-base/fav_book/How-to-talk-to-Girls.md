## Introduction

I'm a dating expert. That's how I make my living. I take special pride in my
ability to talk to anybody, at anytime, anywhere.

I've traveled quite a bit in my time, and regardless of where I find myself,
I'm always able to strike up a conversation. This is especially true with
members of the opposite sex. That's why people come to me for dating
advice.

Well, things weren't always like this. I was actually quite shy back during
my school days. It was only in my twenties that I was able to figure out
certain secrets that enabled me to talk to people.

I am hardly alone. A lot of people are late bloomers. In fact, even if you
think you already know how to approach women, you probably are
operating at below capacity.

That's right. You could be doing so much better. Maybe you are overlooking
some important rule or you're just doing things in a slightly inefficient way,
and this has a tremendous impact on your overall effectiveness.

In this book, I'm going to teach you how to talk to women. It all boils down
to flirting and looking forward to conversing with people.

## Chapter 1 : Why is Flirting So Important?

Flirting is the ability to present your best side to people. That's how you get
women to notice you. That's how you get to talk to them at some length.

Flirting also enables you to open the possibility of something more with
that member of the opposite sex. If you want to be successful in any way,
shape or form in your dating life, you have to know how to flirt.

The problem is, a lot of guys are under the impression that if they're going
to talk to women, it has to lead to some sort of result. And this is why a lot
of them don't take the time to master flirting.

They think that they have this special script that they can turn to only when
they feel that they need to hook up or when they're looking for a new
girlfriend. Other than that, the whole idea of becoming a more flirty or
flirtatious person seems like a waste of time or is simply not worth the
bother.

This really is too bad because if you know how to flirt, the skill sets that
you get can actually apply across the board. It can apply to work, it can
apply to school, and it can apply to any kind of social interaction.

Of course, the whole aim of "flirting" in those contexts is not sexual in
nature. Still, if you know how to flirt, don't be surprised if you have a lot
more doors of opportunity opened to you. Flirting is a key part of human
interaction.

Flirting as Social Lubricant

Pardon the imagery, but flirting is really a social lubricant.

Let's face it, human beings can be rough. Sometimes we say the wrong
things at the wrong time with the wrong people, and we produce the wrong

outcomes. A lot of feelings are hurt, relationships are strained, and we end
up giving the wrong impression.

It's very easy to put the wrong foot forward and it's really hard to make up
for that bad first impression. This happens all the time. I'm sure it has
happened to you.

When you learn how to flirt, you learn to lubricate or soften your social
impact.

I'm not talking about dating here. Even in a non-dating context, if you learn
the basics of flirting, you are more likely to make people comfortable
around you.

You're not putting them off. You're not making them defensive. This goes a
long way in becoming a more effective person.

You're able to be more persuasive, you're able to communicate more clearly,
you're able to rally people around you or around a common cause or goal –
there are just so many things you can do that you weren't able to do when
you were rough around the edges or off-putting.

Please understand that any kind of success in this life has to involve other
people. That's the bottom line.

I don't care if you're the most introverted person in the world. This is the
reality. Accordingly, it's a good idea to lubricate your social interactions
through the power of flirting.

Again, this is not necessarily about dating. You can be talking to your boss,
you can be handling office politics at work, or you can be trying to organize
some sort of social group.

All of these require some sort of social lubricant so everybody is made to
feel at ease to the point that they would listen to you. You then increase the
chances that all of you can work together to produce an outcome all of you
desire.

Flirting's mechanics apply to these situations. Stripped down to its bare
essentials, flirting really is all about presenting yourself in the most pleasing
way possible.

You're trying to disarm the other person. You're trying to pave the way for
your personal charm. It's harder to pull that off when people are put off by
your appearance or they have their defenses up.

Learn how to flirt. It can make the quality of your life so much better.

## Chapter 2 : Why Most Guys Fail to Get the Girl

Why do a lot of guys, and I'm talking about good looking, fit, financially
secure, educated men, fail to get the girl? Too many guys who seemingly
have it together fall flat on their faces when it comes to connecting with
women.

A lot of them are very straightforward. In fact, a lot of them try to talk to
women like they're operating under some sort of schedule. It's as if they
have some deadline they have to meet and they're just blowing through
woman after woman trying to get a date or trying to get something else
going.

Well, that can work if the numbers are big enough.

If you've ever been to Vegas, you know that it really all boils down to the
odds. If you play large enough numbers and if you play enough times,
chances are, something will fall into place and you will get what you came
for.

Unfortunately, playing the numbers game can be hard on your nerves. It
really can. I mean, after all, how many times can you take a no? How many
times can you handle rejection?

A lot of guys talk a good game. They try to project outward strength, but
deep down inside, each and every rejection hurts.

Deep down inside, your insecurities (and all of us have them) get triggered.
You can only handle so much punishment until you start to doubt yourself.
This is why it's really important to not rush through the dating game.

To paraphrase the famous ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu, the
author of "The Art of War": Don't fight battles you know you're going to
lose.

Put in another way, if you're going to fight, make sure you know that you're
going to win. That's hard to pull off when you're in a hurry.

If you think that meeting girls is just a numbers game and it's really just
some sort of quota that you have to fill, then get ready for the rejections.
Get ready for some girls to laugh at you. That's how brutal it could be.

Thankfully, there is a better way.

Another reason why guys fail to get the girl is because they're too eager. If
you look desperate or you smell of desperation, women are going to run for
the hills.

Now, please understand that a lot of them are looking for the same thing
you're looking for. Maybe you're looking for a fling, or maybe you're
looking for something more long term. They're looking for that too.

The problem is, if they think that you're desperate with them, you're
probably desperate with other women. Women hate competition.

Sad to say, too many women are insecure. And unfortunately, if you reek of
desperation, that's precisely the kind of psychological complex you're
triggering in them. It leads to self-doubt.

Also, a lot of women equate desperation with lack of self-confidence. It
seems that, to them, when you go out there and it's obvious that you're
really just trying to get laid or you're just, despite all odds, trying to hook
up, that you're basically throwing one Hail Mary pass after another.

Who wants to hook up with that guy? Do you see how this works?

Finally, women are turned off by desperation because they think that you're
not really a prize. Women want to walk away with a guy that they think
other women would desire.

Since you're desperate and would basically hook up with any woman,
you're not much to be desired because you don't put so much value on

yourself so as to be selective.

Who would want to walk off with a guy that almost any woman can hook
up with? Do you see the psychology from the other side? Women want a
prize.

Prizes, by definition, are something you compete for. They are the products
of competition. In other words, it only goes to the very best, the most
beautiful, and the most worthy.

All that goes away when you show your desperation. You proclaim loud
and clear: "I will hook up with anyone, anytime, anywhere." How prized
would you be? Obviously, you're not prizing yourself enough.

Another common reason why guys fail to get the girl is the fact that they
believe in formulas.

Have you heard of pick-up lines? I'm sure you've used one from time to
time. It's okay. There's no shame in that game. Nobody's immune to this.

The reason why almost all the guys I know are susceptible to pick up lines,
formulas and other tricks is because they don't want to do any original
thinking. Original thinking in the dating context is very hard and is often
threatening.

When you are there with an attractive looking woman at the other end of
the room, you're going to have to do many things. You're going to read the
context, pay attention to your surroundings, look at her face without being
obvious, try to read her, try to figure out what she's about, come up with an
approach, and many other things.

This is too much for too many guys. They'd rather have some sort of magic
bullet solution that they just unpack, add hot water to, and all of a sudden,
they have a hookup. That's how most people think.

Remember, we live in an age of instant pizza. Once you put down that
phone ordering that pizza from your corner pizzeria, you are under the

impression that your pie is going to get to your home in 15 minutes or you
expect it to be free. That's the kind of mindset we all have, thanks to our
modern economy and our modern society.

In most cases, there's nothing wrong with that. But the problem is, when
you apply that same mindset to your dating life, you are putting an
unrealistic pressure on yourself. This is unnecessary pressure.

So instead of appreciating the woman based on her context, based on the
present moment, and acting accordingly, you'd rather use some sort of pick
up line, use some sort of technique or some sort of formula so you can get
what you want as soon as possible.

This is why most guys fail with pick-up lines. They're fun if you're trying to
crack a joke, but they are not as funny or entertaining if you actually expect
them to lead to you getting what you want.

Finally, most guys fail to get the girl because they're selfish. There, I said it.
I know it's politically incorrect, it may seem like I'm insulting the people
who are reading this book, but it needs to be said.

If you are in such a rush to hook up that you don't bother reading the
woman, you don't even bother knowing her, or you are reeking of
desperation, all of this comes from the same place. It's all about selfishness.

You're looking at the whole dating game only on your perspective. It's all
about you, how you can please yourself, and how you can get what you're
looking for.

Here's the problem: the world works on a reciprocal rule. To get what you
want, you must first give people what they want.

Women are looking for prizes. They are looking for men who are worth
going out with or even worth sleeping with. They are looking for men who
bring to the table the things that they are looking for. Until and unless you
know how this works, it's going to be very hard for you.

Now, you can hook up from time to time, but in the big scheme of things,
those don't count. What's important is consistent victory. This is why it's
really important to have something to offer to women, coming in.

I'm not talking about having six-pack abs and great muscles, although that
helps. I'm not talking about necessarily looking like Brad Pitt or Leonardo
Dicaprio, although that definitely helps. I'm not necessarily talking about
having several degrees to your name or making north of seven figures every
year, although those can tremendously help.

What's important is that you have a decent enough package to offer. And,
just as importantly, you know how to position the package.

This is where flirting comes in. Flirting lubricates your social interactions
so that a gateway is created so you can communicate your value to the
woman you desire.

If you don't even bother to do that, then whatever it is you have to offer may
be overlooked. You may be positioning yourself wrong.

You may turn out to be the catch of the century, but people wouldn't know
because you don't know how to position yourself. This is why flirting is so
important.

## Chapter 3: It Doesn't Matter Whether You are an

## Introvert or an Extrovert. You Can Talk to

## Women

I get this objection all the time: "James, I'm an introvert. How can I talk to
women? I like being alone. I don't like crowds. I feel tired when I'm
communicating with somebody in an open setting, much less when I'm
communicating to a large group of people. I'm just simply not cracked up to
talk to women."

Well, I can buy all the previous sentences, except the last one. Seriously. All
guys can talk to women if they just bring themselves up to it.

It really is a skill. I know it's a social skill, but it's just like any other skill.

When you first tried to ride a bike, it wasn't a pleasant experience if you're
like most people. Now, when you get on a bike, chances are, you find your
balance almost instantly and you keep pedaling in a straight line. You
weren't always like that.

I remember the first time I tried to ride a bike. It was a very messy affair. I
skinned my knee, there was blood all over the place – it was not pretty. It
sure hurt like hell.

But guess what? Once you reach that point, and I call this the magic
moment, you keep your balance. You're no longer falling over again and
again.

And then once you achieve your balance, there is this sense of momentum
taking over. You're able to stay on the bike. You're able to bike in a straight
line, and you're able to maintain stability until the end of your bike ride.

Funny how that works, right? Well, this doesn't happen overnight.

Likewise, you shouldn't expect smoothly talking to women (any woman) to
happen overnight. It just doesn't work that way. There's going to be a lot of
thrills, chills, and spills along the way, just like riding a bike.

This observation of basic truth applies to you, regardless of whether you're
an introvert or an extrovert.

It's easy to think that extroverts have it made because these are people who
get energized when they're around people. You can see it in their eyes.

They get excited about people sharing and people sending out emotional
energy. This is the best thing since sliced bread to them.

Introverts, on the other hand, get drained. I ought to know because a lot of
my friends are introverts.

When they get that kind of distant look in their eyes, don't be put off. It
means that they need their special time. They probably need to be away by
themselves for a little bit because they're trying to emotionally recharge.

A lot of them are brilliant people. A lot of them are creative people. They
deal primarily with ideas, which can manifest themselves in amazing
products, beautiful art, you name it.

Introverts are awesome people, but they are wired differently than
extroverts. And just because this is the case, it doesn't mean that they can't
talk to women.

Don't use introversion as an excuse for you to stop learning how to talk to
women. Anybody can talk to women. In fact, one of my introvert friends is
probably the best pick up artist I know.

That's not an exaggeration. How come? He let his introversion and internal
focus allow him to master communicating with women.

Put simply, instead of being introverted about science-fiction, science and
programming, which are all his interests, he devoted a significant chunk of
his brain power to figuring women out. A key part of this is mastering the
art of flirting.

What do you think happened? The guy is just pulling in women like it's
going out of style.

It doesn't matter where we go. Whether it's a corner café, or an art gallery,
or a nearby library, or simply jogging through the park, he would pull
women in like he was some sort of fisherman running a trawler net.

He got it down to a tee. He knew how to look at them. He knew how to spot
the ones who can be approached. He knew how to notice certain things
about a woman that gets her to pay attention, and then gets her to laugh.

As you probably already know, if you've achieved any kind of success with
women, once you get them to laugh, it's smooth sailing from that point on.

Of course, you have to get them to laugh with you, not at you. That's an
important detail. Still, once you get them to laugh, it's pretty much game
over.

This guy who is so introverted, he gets mild panic attacks if he's in large
areas with a lot of people. This is why, for the life of him, he cannot bring
himself up to do public speaking. That's how much crowds and prolonged
group interaction tire him up. But regardless, this guy is able to connect.

I say this because I don't want you to use your introversion as an excuse
from having to learn what you need to learn to become a more effective
human being.

Let's get real here. For you to be a more effective man, you have to know
how to talk to women.

Please understand that just because you talk to women, it doesn't mean that
you expect them to go to bed with you or that the whole point of talking to

women is to get something. No. You just have to learn how to talk to them
because they make up more than half the planet.

Don't let introversion turn into an excuse.

## Chapter 4: Get Your Head Right About

## Conversation Skills Before Making Your Move

There are a lot of misconceptions regarding conversation skills and the
ability to talk to women. They're not one and the same.

It's important to understand that people are selfish by nature. This sounds
depressing. It sounds like an indictment of the human race. It seems like
this judgment or conclusion can only lead to bad things.

But if you think about it, this is actually a good thing, at least as far as
conversation skills are concerned. Since you know that people are selfish
and self-absorbed at some level or another, you can use this to your
advantage.

When you're talking to somebody and you're looking for some sort of topic
that will get that person's attention and keep it, what should you start with?
Here's a dead giveaway: don't start with yourself.

Don't try to sell yourself. Don't try to focus on the stuff that's interesting to
you and what you're up to, and so on and so forth. That gets boring quickly.

How come? Well, back to rule one, people are self-absorbed. It's all about
"what about me" or "what's in it for me."

So, the key here is to turn this human orientation or tendency that we all
already know about to your advantage.

That's right. Talk about them, talk about what they're doing, talk about the
projects that they're working on, and ask a lot of questions.

People love the limelight. People love to be the center of attention.

Of course, you have to do this in a way that is non-interrogatory. You don't
want to come up like some sort of high inquisitor like there's an inquisition
going and you're asking all these questions because you're trying to trap
people or trick them so they basically incriminate themselves and you throw
them in jail.

That's the wrong impression to make. Instead, allow your natural curiosity
to bubble to the surface.

All of us have some sense of curiosity. Some people have more than others,
but still, we all have it in us. Allow yourself to be truly curious about this
person.

Here's the secret: don't focus on the things you are already interested in.
Instead, focus on your curiosity about things you may not be all that aware
of or things that you don't already know.

Because when you talk about new stuff, your natural curiosity comes about
because you're discovering something new. It's something to be excited
about. And the more excited you look about what they're interested in, the
more likely they would keep talking on and on.

Remember, everybody's looking for a stage. Everybody's looking for the
spotlight and you've just given the stage and spotlight to this woman. And
so, she's talking.

She can talk about her childhood, she can talk about the arts and crafts that
she's into, or she can talk about that concert that she goes to every year.
Whatever it is, it's obviously fascinating to her and it's fascinating enough
for you because you don't know it. This is the secret.

Don't focus on the things that you're already interested in because it
eventually would lead to you looking like some sort of interrogator. You're
basically a lawyer in court asking questions that you already know the
answers to.

Obviously, the only reason you're asking such questions is because you're
either trying to trap somebody or make them look bad. Not exactly good
goals when you're trying to get on the good side of somebody who's
attractive to you. Do you see how this works?

Conversation is About Mutual Comfort

Great conversations turn on the person you're talking to being comfortable.
They're comfortable when they talk about the things that they're interested
in. They are comfortable when they see that you're naturally and genuinely
curious about what it is they're talking about.

They are also comfortable when they feel that you accept them. This is
crucial.

When you're talking to somebody and you use a questioning tone like it was
some sort of interrogation, do you think they will feel accepted? Do you
think that they get the sense that they're in some sort of safe space? Do you
think that they feel that you are talking to them for who they are? Obviously
not.

They feel that, "This person is trying to pick apart what I'm saying. This
person may be judging me. This person may be rejecting whatever it is that
I'm saying."

At that point in the conversation, don't be surprised if they get defensive.

When you're accepting, people are more likely to open up. People are more
likely to think that you're an ally. And the more comfortable they become,
the more comfortable you should become. Because remember, this is all
about mirroring.

Great Conversations are About Nonverbal Signals

Talking about mirroring, when you talk to somebody and you were asked
by somebody else to recount everything that you talked about, chances are,

you'll come up with a very small fraction. Still, despite that fact, you can
honestly say that you truly understood the other person.

How can this be? After all, you were only able to get a fraction of what
they're saying?

Well, human communication operates on two different levels. The first level
is obvious. These are the words coming out of that person's mouth. Clearly,
they're saying certain words instead of other words.

Their word choice, the way they put their words together, the mental
pictures that those words trigger, as well as the general meaning of those
words, form the most obvious meaning of whatever it is they're
communicating.

But that's just part of the picture. Based on experience, it turns out that this
is just a small part of the picture. In many cases, the real communication
takes place nonverbally.

What am I talking about? Well, look at their facial expressions. When they
say certain things, do their facial expressions change?

Look at the shape of their eyes. Do they widen or do they get narrower
when they talk about certain topics or when they mention certain sentences?

Pay attention to how quickly they talk as well as the volume in which they
talk. Take note of any gestures they make while they're making certain
points. Pay attention to how they're standing and how they position their
body.

These and hundreds of other signals make up the majority of human to
human communication. These are nonverbal signals, and they play a major
role in how you're supposed to process the words coming out of their
mouths.

Now, please understand that the textual component of person to person
communication is very important. After all, we use certain words and not

other words. We use certain euphemisms. We use certain colloquialisms.

These choices say a lot because we could have used other words. We could
have painted a different picture. We could have set a different tone. But we
didn't.

Any good listener would be able to pick up on this and to try to replicate the
mental image in the mind of the speaker so they are on the same page. This
skill obviously takes years to master.

You really can't master this if you're in a hurry. You really can't master this
if you think you already know the person. You really can't even begin to get
a hold of this skill if you are a very close-minded or prejudiced and biased
person.

But even beyond that, when you look at the nonverbal signals people send
out, they go a long way in making you comfortable or putting you edge.
Pay careful attention to that.

The Great Thing About Conversation Skills

Thankfully, you can learn great conversation skills by simply talking to
people who already possess them.

Just watch them. Look at how they position their ideas. Look at the words
that they use to express it, and pay attention to the rest of the image. I am,
of course, talking about nonverbal signals. You will then be able to get a
composite going.

Now, don't get hung up on the content. They can be talking about their
vacation to Patagonia, or they can be talking about their mother in law, it
doesn't matter. Instead, pay attention to how they communicate and how
comfortable you are.

The more comfortable you are, the clearer the other person becomes, and
you are on the same page. And from there flows emotional parity. You feel
the same emotions as them because they have communicated so clearly.

This is how you get your head right about conversation skills. Don't assume
you already have them. Because if you make your move and your
conversational skills are all self-absorbed and self-centered, it may not work
out as well as you would like.

## Chapter 5: How to Get the Butterflies Out of Your

## Stomach

If you're talking to somebody new, it's very easy to get butterflies in your
stomach. In fact, in many cases, it's inevitable.

How come? Well, you don't know the person. You don't know what they're
about, and you don't know what they're going to say.

There are just so many variables out there. And all this uncertainty is sure to
have an impact on your mindset. You really don't know what you're getting
into.

Now, here's the secret. At this point, you really have two choices. You can
choose to be fearful, or you can choose to be adventurous. It really all boils
down to those two choices.

Choose Adventure

It's very easy to see why people would be fearful of new people. You don't
know them.

They may look really good so you might feel that they may reject you
because they don't know you. You don't exactly know what you would get,
you don't want to be judged, and so on and so forth.

There are so many things that you want to avoid. And unfortunately, since
you don't know this person enough, those things might bubble to the
surface.

There might be opportunities where the things that you fear like rejection,
judgment or ridicule might happen. But that's the chance that you will need
to take if you want to connect with somebody new.

If you want to learn something new, you're going to have to toughen up a
little bit and take your chances.

The good news is that you don't have to start the conversation from a
position of fear. Because when you look at everything that I have listed
above, they all come from the same place. They're all byproducts of fear.

Let's get one thing clear, people are creatures of habit. We get accustomed
to certain patterns. We have certain expectations. In fact, in many cases, we
expect things to be the same for a long time. Any kind of novelty or any
kind of change usually doesn't sit well with people.

Now, this doesn't mean that they are completely paranoid of change. This
doesn't mean that their whole world starts to break apart. It doesn't have to
be dramatic that way, but it doesn't sit well.

They think that, "It isn't something that I've seen before. It isn't something
that I know I'm comfortable with."

You have to overcome this by replacing it with another thing that you
already have. I am, of course, talking about your curiosity.

If you've ever been a kid, and all of us qualify, curiosity ruled your life.
That's how you learned to become a human being. That's how your brain
created the necessary neural pathways that paved the way for you being a
successful adult.

By successful, I'm not talking about making a lot of money, gaining a lot of
respect, prestige and status. I'm talking about successful in the sense that
you developed into an adult with adult faculties. The foundation for all of
that is curiosity.

You have to be curious enough with other people, with the natural world,
and with your own body to put together all the information you need to
become a successful adult. That's how you mature. That's how you grow up.
And it all comes back to curiosity.

The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity

If you are ready to step up to this hot female and you can tell that you're
nervous and you've got butterflies in your stomach, please understand that
this is perfectly natural.

It's okay to feel this way. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not a
freak. You're not a nerd. You're not a social untouchable. This happens to
everybody.

Again, we're all creatures of habit. We get accustomed to certain things.
That's why we fear change at some level or another. This is perfectly okay.

But you have to go to the next step. The next step is to allow your curiosity
to override and overpower your fear.

Because if you stay in a fearful state, even if you manage to step up to the
woman and talk to her, you're making things harder on yourself. Instead of
setting her at ease, a lot of your fear and anxiety might seep through.

People are not stupid. They can read between the lines. People know how to
implement the things that I've talked about in the previous sections.

Do you think you're the only person who can pick up nonverbal signals?
She can do it too. And if you are operating out of fear or anxiety, that's
going to show sooner or later.

It can show in the words that you choose. It can show in your facial
expressions. You may give yourself away based on your posture and body
language. There are so many things that could go wrong.

This is why it's really important, before you step up to somebody, to get the
butterflies out of your stomach. One of the best ways to do this is to tap into
your curiosity.

I don't care what it is you do for a living. Maybe you work in an industry
where curiosity really is in short supply, maybe you are a very rigid thinker,

or maybe you're just used to highly predictable systems – it doesn't matter.
Seriously.

None of that matters because all of us, at some level or another, have some
sort of reservoir of curiosity because we needed it as children. And the good
news is that this reservoir never really dried up when we became adults. I
need you to tap into that.

Allow yourself to be curious about the woman that you're about to talk to.
Where does she come from? What does she do for a living? What school
did she go to? What experiences does she have? What does she think about
certain things?

Get pumped up by the fact that you're going to learn something new.

Here's the Secret: Practice Empathy

All of us have the ability to imagine. I'm sure you've done it before.

If you compare yourself to a lot of people because you're envious, you
probably do this all the time. You put yourself in their position. You put
yourself in their shoes and you try to look at the world from their
perspective.

One of the best ways to truly implement deep curiosity is to take the extra
step of empathy.

Put yourself in the position of that woman. How would you think she's
feeling? How do you think she'd like to be approached? What kind of topics
do you think she would like to talk about once she has clued you in to
things that she's interested in?

Do you think that after she said that she's big into NGOs and nonprofit
foundations that she'd be interested in you talking about your Ferrari or how
expensive your fur coat is? Probably not.

The point here is that you should make sure that your curiosity motivates
you enough for you to practice empathy.

The moment you get in her head and the moment you can predict a lot of
the things that she's saying because you carefully and correctly read her is
the moment you've won.

It takes quite a bit of curiosity to get there. It also takes discipline to
overcome your natural tendency to make the conversation all about you.

If you're able to do that and tap into your creativity and curiosity, empathy
will do the rest. That's how you get the butterflies out of your stomach.

Because at some level or another, you will notice that "She's just as scared
as me. This is uncertain. There are all sorts of things that could go wrong."

But there's also a lot of beauty to this. There's that chance of discovery.
There's always that chance of learning something that you didn't already
know, which can enrich you as a person.

## Chapter 6 : It all begins with eye contact and

## learning to fight the right battles.

Before I launch into the meat and potatoes of this chowder, let me tell you
the story of my friend Terencio. My buddy Terencio is from Central
California, and he has always imagined himself as the quintessential Latin
lover. He would go to clubs with the wide, open butterfly collars, gold
chain, and really tight pants.

Most of the time, his suits and shirts are made out of silk. He wasn’t exactly
a wallflower, let’s put it that way. He really made it a point to stand out in
the crowd. He loved to dance salsa. The way he danced, however, was
unmistakable. There can be a thousand people on the dance floor, and you
can easily spot Terencio.

He made no bones about wanting to be the center of attention. What really
blew my mind was that Terencio is all of 5’1. In the United States, the
average height is around 6’2. So as you can tell, Terencio, oftentimes got
attention in the worst way possible.

People were wondering to themselves and thinking, “Why is this midget or
dwarf boogieing away on the dance floor?” Well, that’s part of Terencio’s
charm. Because it doesn’t matter whether the woman he’s approaching is
over 5’1, which most American women are. He had a distinct charm and a
lot of it turned on his brazened fearlessness.

I don’t know about you, but women are excited about that because they
know, just like most people, that deep down inside, we are scared of
looking like a fool. We don’t want to stick out like sore thumbs. In fact, if
given a choice, too many of us would like to be another face in the wall.
There is something to be said about conformity because it’s so safe. We
don’t want to stand out.

Well, Terencio knows this, and this is why his persona was so larger than
life. He knew that he could attract a lot of attention that way and that his
fearlessness and boldness would turn on a lot of women. A lot of guys are
sheep. Now, please understand that a lot guys go to the gym, they look
tough, they’re quiet, they look hard. In fact, a lot of them, when pushed, can
actually do some courageous stuff.

But even the bravest guy is going to have a tough time doing what Terencio
did, because he is basically skating on a knife’s edge. One minute he’s a
clown, another minute he’s a hero. Most people can’t deal with that kind of
attention. Terencio knew all of this, and that’s why he used it to his
advantage, and he would pull in women all day, every day.

I shared Terencio’s story because he had a plan coming in; most guys don’t.
When guys find themselves in any kind of social setting, they basically
leave themselves to scramble. They basically don’t come in with a plan, and
they think they know what to do when the time comes. Well, that’s too
much of an assumption to make.

If you’re like most guys, you probably are clueless. You wouldn’t know the
first thing about hooking up, making the right impression, flirting with
women. How come? Well, you didn’t prepare for it. Again, this goes back
to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu.

In his book Art of War, he made a big point about fighting the right battles.
It doesn’t matter whether you have the best army in the world. It doesn’t
matter whether your army is staffed with the bravest soldiers. Every dog has
its day, and if your opponent knows how to play the game right, he can, and
will beat you.

To paraphrase Sun Tzu’s strategy, hit the enemy when he is weak, run away
when he is strong. In other words, learn to fight the right battles.
Unfortunately, a lot of guys are clueless about this. They go into any kind of
social setting, and they only have one approach. In many cases, it’s the
worst approach in the world, because they’re just going to try to ram
themselves through to connect with women.

As you can well imagine, this boils down, yet again, to a numbers’ game.
For every hundred times you try to do that, maybe you’d be lucky 5% of the
time. You may be thinking, “Well, that’s the way it goes.” So try and try
again. Like I said earlier in this book, you’re more than welcome to do that.
But let me tell you, every rejection hurts.

The first few times, you probably would be able to take it on the chin. But
once you get rejected 10 times in a row, it starts to get personal. When you
get rejected 20 times, then you start doubting yourself, and it becomes
really messy after that point.

The good new is you don’t have to play the game to lose. You just have to
learn how to fight the right battles.

Begin with eye contact

When you are in a social setting, and there are a lot of females there, take a
scan around the room. Don’t dwell on a particular female because she might
think you’re creepy. But keep your eyes moving and scan around the room.

If you noticed that one woman or a few look back at you, then it means
there is at least a possibility of mutual interest. Of course, course, you can’t
read too much into this because naturally, people look back at you when
you look at them. Usually, this is a sign of confidence. A confident person
would look at you when you are looking at them.

Some people are very defensive, other people are just acknowledging that
you are looking at them, they want to know what’s up. Usually, it doesn’t
mean much of anything. Still, be prepared when women look back at you.
Because it indicates that there is at least a possibility of interest. Don’t play
the game that a lot of guys play. Basically, they focus on the appearance of
the women.

They think that this chick in front of them is the best thing since sliced
bread, and come hell or high water, they’re going to step up to her. The
problem is, she is looking down. She is looking to the side. It's obvious she

doesn’t want you to approach her for whatever reason. Don’t push it. It all
begins with eye contact. If you don’t get eye contact back, move on.

Learn to fight the right battle

If you don’t get the eye contact back, it’s a good idea not to approach that
woman. The pathway isn’t there. Maybe, she will warm up to you, as the
night goes on, maybe not. What’s important is you shouldn’t push yourself.
You’ll come off as pushy; she might think your imposing on her. So do
yourself a big favor, focus on the type of women you’re prepared for.

If you come in to any kind of social setting with some sort of background as
to how to handle certain types of women, then stick to those women. This is
no time to try something new because you may get crushed in a very public
way.

Now, I’m not saying this to discourage you, I’m saying this to basically
push you to prepare. For example, if you have a good batting record with
nerdy girls (these are intellectual-looking girls with glasses, you know,
really cute type of women), then look for that type. See if you can get eye
contact, and then talk to them.

In other words, stick with what you know. If you are going to be doing
some experimentation, do it in a more controlled environment. I’m not
saying that you should completely stick with the types of women you
approach in the past. I’m saying you should prepare for new women in a
more controlled environment. This way, when you go into a social setting,
you have come prepared. You at least have something to go on and work
with: A little bit of confidence goes a long way.

Why do I insist that you should learn how to fight the right battles? Why do
I insist that you should approach women who are similar to women whom
you have approached before. Well, chances are you’re more likely to appear
confident in front of women whom you think you could talk to.

This may not actually be true, but it doesn’t matter. You have the
appearance of confidence, go with it. You at least have that advantage going

on. Compare this with approaching a woman who is completely out of your
league or doesn’t match your track record. She may be very interesting, but
she could also be very intimidating.

And the worst part of all of this, is any missteps on your part can easily be
blown out of every proportion, and you can make a fool out of yourself. I’m
not saying that you should be so scared that you don’t even try, but at least
have some sort of template, some matrix, some sort of framework to work
with.

Otherwise, you’ve just stepped up to a woman who is just completely
different from what you’re used to. Anything goes, and unfortunately, 9
times out of 10, the outcome is negative instead of positive.

## Chapter 7 : Remember That You Are A Complete

## Package

As I have mentioned in the previous chapter, when you communicate,
you’re not just communicating with the words coming out of your mouth.
You’re not just talking to people, you’re not just verbalizing ideas. You are
also communicating in non-verbal ways.

As I have mentioned earlier, your body language forms a big part of the
equation; the way you stand, your overall posture, your choice of clothes,
your facial expressions, the gestures you use, etc. Now, please understand
that some people are more sensitive to this than others. Still, even the most
insensitive person and the most socially inept person will still pick this up.

Now, of course, that person would need to be around you a little bit longer,
but even they will get it. You have to make sure that you remember that you
are a complete package. You’re not just there with a script. You’re not just
there with some sort of resume. When you’re talking to somebody, it’s not
like you can just point to that Mercedes in the parking and tell them, “Yeah,
I own that.” It doesn’t work that way.

They are judging you on many different levels. And in many cases, the way
you say something is actually more important than what you have to say,
because ultimately, human communication is about context. People are
always asking themselves, “Can I trust this person?" “Is there any good
reason for me to think that this person is legit?" “How similar is this person
to me? Can this person bring some sort of value to the table?”

You have to understand that human beings are always asking themselves a
very basic question when they encounter anything in the universe. Most
people won’t own up to this, most people definitely won’t say this out loud,
but it’s there. What question is it are they asking: What’s in it for me?

If you understand this, then you should conduct yourself based on what you
can offer that person. Maybe you can offer them humor. Maybe you can
offer them affinity for their likes and dislikes. You have to understand that
people have a built-in preference for others that are just like them or similar
enough to them.

If you think about it, this makes all the sense in the world, because if human
beings from thousands of years ago did not have a preference towards other
human beings that are similar enough to them, humanity probably would
have died out. How come? Well, if we were warm and friendly to hostile
people, then we would have killed each other, and killed off the human
species.

This is why the human tendency to like people who are similar to them has
been passed down through the generations. It gives a competitive advantage
to people who have that gene or tendency. Compare that with people who
have the tendency to welcome strangers with open arms. Those people
probably would not have a chance to pass on their genes. How come?
They’re dead!

So from a purely self-preservation perspective, people like others who are
similar enough to them. Keep this in mind. This way, you can see that there
are many different signals that you’re sending, and they'd better be on point.
Otherwise, you’re left to rely on gimmicks or props. You’re left with pick-
up lines, canned stories, or other social props that may or may not work.

Now, I know women who still go out with a guy even though he tells corny
jokes and tells the exact same stories like everybody else. The reason, of
course, those women think he’s hot. But outside of that situation, you’re
going to have to come up with something new.

At the very least, you have to come up with something that looks like it’s
new. Otherwise, it’s going to be very hard to establish rapport and mutual
comfort. Remember, if you want to be viewed as likeable or interesting,
make people comfortable around you.

## Chapter 8 : Fake It Until You Make It

If you totally ignore all the advice that I give you on this book, at least try
to get this one right. For whatever reason, not everybody can use the
techniques that I share here. For whatever reason, they may feel that they
cannot monitor their non-verbal and verbal signals. Maybe, it’s a matter of
bad timing, or their situation just doesn’t line up and they can’t look into
mirroring.

Perhaps, they have had an opportunity to engage in reciprocity. Maybe they
have passed trauma, and looking people in the eye is quite inconvenient or
downright uncomfortable for them.

Whatever the situation may be, there's always one fallback. And the great
thing about this fallback is that guys like you have been able to rely on this
since time immemorial. What am I talking about? Use the social technique
of faking it until you make it.

Faking what?

Faking it until you make it, really is all about modeling. You model yourself
after another person. All human beings, at some level or another, are able to
model themselves after other human beings. This is a key part of growing
up.

Remember when you were a kid, and you would always repeat what your
father or mother said? That's part of you learning how to model. Now, when
you were a kid, you were doing it as a joke. Your mom and dad probably
had a good time and laughed with you. But that phase actually played a
major role in your development as a human being.

At some level or another, we model ourselves. We may not be all that aware
of it, but it happens. Now, the good news is if you model yourself after the
right people, you would be able to get a head start. At least, you have

something to start with; you are not starting out empty-handed. You're not
coming out unprepared.

Now, of course, you can only take this so far. Eventually, you would have to
come up with something on your own. You have to come up with
something that fits your particular set of personal circumstances. You have
to understand that we are all different people.

We come from different backgrounds; we have different experiences. We
have different opinions. We look at the world differently. That's perfectly
okay, but please understand that all those differences do add up.

Faking it until you make it can only work up to a certain point. Past that
point, you're going to have to fill in the details. You're going to have to step
in and come up with your own social strategy that reflects your experiences,
your desires and your needs.

Still, faking it until you make it is a great starting point. Who are you going
to fake? Who are you going to model after? Model yourself after confident
guys.

Confidence knows no color, body size, weight, or appearance

I know the subheading to this section is quite a bold point. You might even
be rolling your eyes right now. You might even be having a hard time
believing what you just read. But I really mean it, seriously.

Why? I have gone through many dance clubs throughout my years. I have
gone through many singles' clubs, and I have found myself in a wide range
of social situations involving members of the opposite sex.

One thing I can confidently say is that a lot of the confident guys there who
pull in women all day, every day like it's going out of style: don't fit a
particular type. It's so much easier if we could just all agree that if you look
like George Clooney or Leonardo DiCaprio, and you walk into a club, you
hook up all day, every day. But my own experience tells me otherwise.

When I go to those clubs and social spaces, I noticed that a lot of the guys
who tend to be the most successful with women don't really look all that
good. Now, understand that there're a lot of social expectations regarding
how guys should look so they could become more sexually attractive to
women.

Old stereotypes like being muscular, having a flat six-pack abs, very good-
looking or having the chiseled good looks of a Greek or Roman god, etc.
There's of course the obligatory good job, or a professional title, or tons of
money in the bank.

But what if I told you that in many cases, it's the complete opposite. A lot of
these guys are not in good shape. A lot of these guys, don't look all that
good. A lot of these guys don't even have clear skin. Many guys look like
they don't have that much money or have much professional career going
on.

Still, regardless of those seeming deficits or disadvantages, they pull in
women all day, every day. Their secret? Confidence. In Chapter 6, I shared
the story of my friend Terencio. Terencio is amazing because he is like the
proverbial male peacock.

You have to understand that the peacock's tail is actually impractical. It is so
big; It s so long and bulky that it can actually put the male peacock's life in
danger. If there's a group of peacocks and a fox tries to go for some peacock
meat for lunch, that long tail is going to make the male peacock very
vulnerable.

Still, female peacocks love guys with massive tails. Paradoxical, right?
Well, if you think about it, it isn't because the more flashy you are,
regardless of how many people think you're cheesy or downright corny,
you're still flashy, you're still gaining attention, you're still putting yourself
out there.

In other words, you're doing something that a lot of these women wish they
could do. That's one form of confidence. Another form of confidence is that
regardless of how seemingly out of your league you are, you step up.

It's like the high school class nerd and social leper stepping up to the prom
queen. How brazen! How audacious! How bold! Well, women are looking
at that, and they would see, "Well, he stepped up to the top tier, he's
swinging for the fences. What does this guy have?"

Now, it doesn't really matter whether he strikes out with the alpha female.
What's important is that this guy has a pair of brass ones. Because in a bold
and public way, he is saying to all the females in that room, "I hold myself
to a very high standard. This is the level that I'm playing at. I've got it at
some level or another. And I have something that most of the guys here, as
good looking yet insecure they may be, don't."

You see how this works? Model yourself after confident guys. I'm not
saying that you should model yourself necessarily after guys like Terencio
who, I would admit, is kind of an outlier. Still, if you have confident
friends, model yourself after them.

It's like you're playing a role. Now, here's the thing, don't get stuck in the
role because at a certain point, you're just play acting. At a certain point,
you're just lying. Don't do that. Instead, use the whole "fake it until you
make it" strategy as an initial framework until you can feel your way
around.

That's how it works, because eventually, you grow out of it. Eventually, you
come up with your own foundation. But the good news is you can use this
tried and proven starting strategy as some sort of scaffolding for your ego.

Once your ego and personality have become solidified and more confident
with women, then you can let go of faking it until you make it and just be
yourself. But until that time, this is a good fallback. Use it.

## Chapter 9 : Don't Assume The Worst When You

## Talk To Women

I don't know about you but when I play basketball, I always try to assume
that when I make a shot, the ball is going to go through that ring. Believe it
or not, just by choosing to be optimistic about my chances as well as my
basketball abilities, I do quite well on the court.

Now, I'm not exactly saying that I'm the second coming of Lebron James,
but I do quite well in basketball because I choose to believe that when I take
a shot, there's a good chance it will come in.

Now, I'm not going to fool myself and say that I'm going to sink every 3-
point shot I take; I'm not exactly Stephen Curry. But my point is, a little bit
of belief in what you're doing, what you're capable of, and your value as a
human being goes a long way.

Unfortunately, I don't see this with a lot guys out there when it comes to the
dating scene. I've been around a lot of guys. I have counseled and advised a
lot of guys when it comes to picking up women. And let me tell you, one
common reason so many guys strike out with the ladies is because they
assume the worst.

It's as if they sabotage their 3-point shot while they're still thinking about
making the shot. Can you imagine Stephen Curry saying to himself over
and over again, "I'm going to miss this shot?"

Now, it doesn't matter how naturally skilled Stephen Curry is. It doesn't
matter how great he is on the hard court and how many times he has sunk
that shot in the past. When he keeps repeating that internal monologue over
and over again, what do you think happens?

That's right, it erodes his actual skill set. Remember, people can get good at
anything through sheer repetition and learning. It doesn't matter how

complex it may be to begin with. It doesn't matter how seemingly
convoluted the task is. If you repeat it over and over again in a wide range
of context and situations, eventually you will get it.

In fact, if you repeat it enough, eventually you will master it. Well, imagine
those processes playing out in Stephen Curry's head, but all of that goes
down the toilet because he keeps playing this message to himself.

Stop assuming the worst, because the truth is, you're not as bad as you
think. A lot of guys, they assume the worst about themselves. All their
insecurities come out, and this is why they continue to struggle with
women.

It doesn't matter how well put together their lives are. Maybe they got
advanced degrees. Maybe they went to great colleges. Maybe they're
making a lot of money, and they're the head honchos in their company.
Maybe they look really good, and they have really nice cars and live in big
houses on the right side of town, etc.

None of that objective reality counts as far as their confidence goes.
Instead, they focus on what's missing, or at least, what they think is
missing. They don't focus on what they're doing right, they don't focus on
the things that other people envy them for. They don't care about any of
that.

Instead, they look at what is missing. And when they go to any kind of
social setting, they think that they're nerds, or they're geeks, or they're
socially flawed or socially inept. And it's only a matter of time until these
women find them out.

Well, let me tell you, a lot of that is just playing in your head. Those are
worst-case scenarios. In fact, in many cases, people don't even see them.
The good news is you don't have to allow to people to see your insecurities.

You have a right to your insecurities because, hey, everybody has
insecurities. All of us are insecure at some level or another. The issue is
whether you're going to be so public about it. The second issue is whether

you are going to let these insecurities undermine and sabotage your success
with the ladies.

Unfortunately, when you always assume the worst when you talk to women,
your insecurities come out. You often make a situation, that is otherwise
normal or neutral, or even positive, into something negative. How do I
know? Well, I used to do that.

When I first started dating, I would always think that the woman I was
talking to, was looking at me like I had a piece of salad stuck in my front
teeth. As you can well imagine, I wasn't all that successful when I first
started out. Because I was always second-guessing myself, I was always
projecting my insecurity.

Don't assume the worst. In fact, you should assume the opposite. Assume
that this is an opportunity for you to communicate and get through to
another human being. This is an opportunity for you to exercise your
natural curiosity. If anything else, you are going to learn something new
tonight.

When I changed my attitude from assuming the worse to assuming some
sort of learning and feeling pumped up about it, my dating success ratio
shot through the roof. How come? Well, the women I was talking to no
longer detected a guy who was trying to prove something. They no longer
perceive me as insecure.

Instead, I looked and talked and felt like somebody who is comfortable in
his own skin. Let me tell you, when you project comfort, because you
yourself truly are comfortable, people are more likely to feel comfortable
around you. They are more likely to open up. They're more likely to share.
They are more likely to look at you in a very favorable light.

Unfortunately, if you assume the worst and the signals that you're sending
out are tortured, ambiguous, and awkward, either women will think you're
creepy, or they don't want to have anything to do with you because a lot of
them are already feeling that way.

They went to those social places. They hang out with their friends and
friends of friends because they want to feel good. And here you are
assuming the worst and projecting all these negative signals, expecting
women to dig you. You see what's wrong with that picture? Good.

Don't assume the worst when you talk to women. They can't read your
mind. They don't think you're the biggest geek in the world. They don't
think that you are a loser. They don't think that you are extremely insecure,
and you're very emotionally fragile.

They're not thinking any of that until, and unless you give them a reason to.
So park your anxieties and insecurities and just allow yourself to be curious.
Allow yourself to zero in on the moment and chill out. It's not as hard as
you think.

## Chapter 10 : Find The Victory In Every

## Conversation

Conversations with women can be very tricky. You probably already know
this. Have you ever talked to a chick that you're really into, and she seems
to have everything that you are looking for in a future girlfriend? She has a
great voice, she has a very cute way of wrinkling her nose or squinting her
eyes when she is making a point or saying certain words. She has a cute
chuckle, and even her very breath is cute.

I've met a lot of women like that, and they are very intoxicating. It's as if
they have their own world and the more you look into their eyes, you can't
help but be drawn in to fully bathe in their presence and uniqueness.

The problem is a lot of guys are hell bent on having such a smooth
conversation where the woman you're talking to just thinks you are the
smartest or most engaging guy on the planet. Anything short of this
fictional scenario is a complete and total disaster. What do you think will
happen? Let me dispense with a mystery.

The disaster will come; this is a self-fulfilling prophecy because you hold
yourself to such a high standard that few people would meet. Seriously,
even great comedians with impeccable timing, like Eddy Murphy or Louis
CK, would have a tough time with such conversations because, hey, we're
all human beings. And since you are conversing with another human being
that you may not know all that well, there will be dull spots. There might
even be awkward silences.

Embrace the silence. Understand that it's part of the game. An awkward
silence actually doesn't have to be awkward. It can be a comfortable silence.
Back when I was still learning the ropes of meeting and talking to women, I
told myself that I'm going to have to always make the very best impression.

In other words, I was out to prove something. If I didn't prove myself, that
I'm a complete and total pile of garbage. That was my mindset; it was a
black and white mindset and it did not do me any good. In fact, it sabotaged
me and undermined me in every step of the way.

When I talked to women with that pressure on me, I felt like every second
there is a gap in the conversation, was a judgment against me. This must
mean I'm a lousy conversationalist. This must mean that she thinks I'm a
dork. This must mean that she thinks I said something wrong, or I turned
her off, or I offended her at some level or another.

Add a million and one reasons knocking around in my head as to why the
conversation has dropped off a cliff. It turns out that in most cases, this
wasn't the situation at all. Whenever you talk to other people, whether
you're talking to your buddy or you're talking to your boss, there will
always be lags, there will always be silences. But they don't have to be
awkward.

Do you know what makes them awkward? Your insecurity. What makes
them awkward is your need to make a statement. You will find yourself in
one awkward conversation after another, filled with all sorts of gaps and
silences, when you are out to make a point, or you are laboring under the
false assumption that all your conversations have to be flawless.

You and I know that's just impossible. Thankfully, there is an alternative.

Find the victory in every conversation

In every conversation, no matter how seemingly awkward, there is a
victory. The victory is this: Embrace the silence. When you're with a very
interesting person, she would step back and be silent for some time, and you
should be silent as well. When you do that, it doesn't have to be awkward.

Instead, you're just taking each other in. You are soaking each other's
presence because you like what you see. You like the conversation that
you're having. You like each other's company. And it is precisely within

these gaps that you can send non-verbal signals that reinforce whatever
level of comfort she already has in you.

You can create an upward spiral. You project non-verbal signals of comfort,
she projects it back. You send signals of acceptance, and you look at her
with wide-open eyes of acceptance and friendly affection. And she feels
even more comfortable and bounces those signals back to you.

You feel like you belong, she feels like she belongs, and on and on it goes.
The key here is, of course, to avoid the friend zone. I have another book on
that, and it's probably a good idea for you to pick up that book because
there are certain intricate rules involved so you don't end up in the friend
zone.

The friend zone is a prison. After all, you're trying to hook up with this
woman sexually. Unfortunately, there's usually no sex going on in the friend
zone. So pick up that book, it really lays down what you need to do so you
can avoid that horrendous place.

Still, when you send out signals of comfort, it is a tremendous victory for
both of you. If you have a best friend, you probably know that some of the
best times with your best friend involved inside jokes. These are just
specific moments that are essentially meaningless to the rest of the universe
but mean a lot to you and your friend, because you went through the same
thing, you went through those moments.

They mean something to you. There's a certain vocabulary of non-verbal
signals that you both share at that specific place and time. This is why best
friends always talk about the past and zero in on those events, because those
events speak volumes about just how well they know each other.

Believe it or not, those pauses where you take in each other, and you just
basically connect with each other, as you become more and more
comfortable with each other, are victories. Find them in every conversation,
and build on them.

Please understand that they're opportunities for an upward spiral. I can't
even begin to tell you how many times I have been in conversations with
women that seemed like it was headed towards a dead end. But once I
stepped in and noticed that we could create an upward spiral of mutual
comfort, I was able to turn it around.

The night did not end up in a disaster. Understand how this works. It's not
as hard as you think. It all boils down to you looking for that opportunity
and running with it. It's all about you establishing mutual comfort.

Now here's the thing: You're going to have to do it. You're going to have to
take the initiative. You're going to have to take the first move, because you
couldn't really expect the woman to do it. That's not her job. You have to do
it.

I know a lot of guys who are basically man-babies; that's really the best way
to describe them. They have the body of a man, they have the job and the
educational attainment of a man, obviously the social stature of a full-
grown male human being, but deep down inside, is this scared boy who
insists that everybody spoon feeds him, just like mom used to do.

Don't be that guy, seriously. Because if you expect the women you meet to
baby you, you're going to have a tough time. Because you're going to have
to take the first step, you're going to have to take the initiative. And what
makes this really challenging, is that after you make the first step, you're
going to have to take a second step, and the step after that, etc.

That's how men do it. That's what defines a real man. It's all about taking
responsibility. You can take ownership of the situations you find yourself in,
because you can always choose your train of thought. Just because there are
these awkward silences, doesn't mean that the conversation has to be a
disaster.

You have a lot more control over the situation than you give yourself credit
for. Use that control, take advantage of it. Choose to do it.

## Chapter 11 : The secret to getting women (and

## others) to like you: Be curious

I know I've mentioned, several times in this book, that if you want to truly
become a good conversationalist, you have to be curious. I have also said
that all of us have a certain level of curiosity. Some people are more curious
than others. There are, of course, natural gossips. There are people who just
can't help but get into other people's business.

I'm not saying that you should be that curious, but you have to tap into
whatever natural curiosity you already possess. The good news is that all of
us have this capability. Remember, if you want the woman you're talking to,
to feel good about you and feel comfortable, you have to be curious about
her. You don't have to go overboard, but you just have to be curious enough.

It just has to be obvious that you want to truly know about her. She's not
just another statistic to you. She is not just another notch on your
headboard. She is not another conquest. You have to sincerely be curious in
what she has to say. Maybe you're interested in what she's about, what she's
been through, the things that she has seen, etc.

Everybody has an interesting story to tell

If you really have a tough time becoming authentically curious about other
people, always remember this truth: everybody has a story. That's the
bottom line; everybody has a story. You might think that the story
somebody could share is the most boring in the world. Well, you only need
to practice a little bit of empathy, and you would see that everybody has an
interesting story to tell.

Even if their story is similar to other stories you've heard, you are still
getting it from a different perspective. You're still getting it from a different
pair of eyes. That is something to celebrate. That is something to be truly

curious about. If anything, it will reinforce the things that you already
know, or at least provide another point of view.

You have to understand that women are not as dumb or insensitive as you
may have been led to believe. In fact, women are very intuitive and know
that is not just a stereotype, it is the truth. They can tell a phony from the
real thing. They can see right through you, and unfortunately, you're the last
one to know. Instead of relying on gimmicks, pick up lines, and other
boring formulas, just be yourself.

I know you've heard that many times before. In fact, in our American
culture "be yourself" is some sort of mantra. Indeed, people repeat it so
often, most people don't really have a clue as to what it means. Let me
break it down to you. "Be yourself" means (at least within the context of a
conversation) to tap into your natural curiosity.

You're being curious in your own specific way. You're not putting on a
show. You're not trying to impress people. You're not trying to send signals
that you think will get you what you're looking for. In other words, you're
not acting. You're not being a hypocrite. You're not lying. This is the real
deal. This is why you need to tap into that genuine curiosity that lies within
you.

All of us men have a little boy trapped deep within us. I need you to get in
touch with that little boy. I need you to look through his eyes at this woman
and find something you could be interested in. The good news is that if you
dig deep enough, and if you search hard enough, you will find an interesting
angle.

She's not just another pretty face. She's not just a sultry voice in the dark.
She's not just a pleasurable presence; she's something more than. And when
you are curious, you communicate that, because even though your
interaction might just lead to a one-night stand or a short-term fling, in that
moment you're with her, she meant something.

This is where authentic and sincere curiosity comes in. Tap into that, it can
lead you to amazing places. And the best part? You would be better off for

it.

## Chapter 12 : People can really tell if you are

## paying attention, so make it all about them

I already mentioned in the previous chapter that if you want people to think
that you are the best conversationalist in the world, give them an
opportunity to talk about themselves. Boy do people love to talk about
themselves. It's as if they're waiting for this invisible pedestal, and when
you present it, they eagerly climb on board; everybody's guilty of this at
some time. I know I have.

When given a chance to talk about myself, I usually take it. This is part of
the human condition, there's no need to be embarrassed about this. There's
no need to try to hide it, or explain it away. It is just part of who we are.
Human beings are addicted to validation. Some people play a better game
than others. Some people try to pass it off like they don't really need
everybody else's attention.

They try to give the impression that they march to the beat of their own
drummer, and that they are their own person. Well, that's just a public
persona, because even that persona is intended for some sort of audience.
It's supposed to attract attention. In other words, it wants the exact same
thing that everybody else wants except in a more subversive or "hip" way.

But despite the games, despite the appearances, deep down inside, we all
share this in common; we like attention. We like to be made to feel that we
matter. We like to feel validated. This is why it's really important to learn
the art of paying attention.

Begin with physical signals

You know somebody is paying attention to you when their chest is open to
you, and the angle of their chest is parallel to yours. You're basically talking
face-to-face, eye to eye, heart-to-heart, body to body. There may be a few
feet in front of you, but by this person's attention is unmistakable. You are

the object of this person's attention. This person has sat up and is now
paying attention to you.

Do the same to other people. Don't talk to people with your face turned to
them, but your feet pointed at the door. Not only is that disrespectful, it is
also obvious. Stop crossing your arms. You're trying to connect with people.
You're trying to make them feel comfortable around. When you cross your
arms, you're being defensive, or you're trying to project, either intentionally
or unintentionally, some sort of strength.

This is not a game of intimidation. Instead, you're trying to communicate to
the other person that you are truly open to them. You are truly paying
attention to them, and that's why you're not crossing your arms. You're not
engaged in any kind of defensive body language.

Your number-one objective, while you're talking to them, is to give them
your full attention in the present moment. You're not looking at your watch.
You're not rolling your eyes. You're not looking over your shoulder. You're
not looking at the scene behind this person's head. You're looking at them
straight in the eye, and then looking away, then straight in the eye again.
You're nodding your head, and you are otherwise letting them know with
your nonverbal signals that they have your full 100% attention at that place
and at that time.

Confirm that you are paying attention

How do you reassure the person speaking to you that you are truly paying
attention to them? You can nod your head. You can say, "Ah, I get you," or
you can summarize some of what they're saying and then bounce it back to
them. No matter how you do it, you just need to do it. You have to let them
know, in no uncertain terms, that you are not only paying attention, but
whatever it is they're saying is registering with you.

When you do this, you let it be known to this person that they are important
enough, and that they matter enough to you for you to go through the
mental gymnastics of bouncing back and summarizing what they said. As

you probably already know, this is not always easy, because a lot of people
do this the wrong way.

For example, somebody may be saying to ten things, and the person they're
talking to can only barely summarize one thing that they said. This can
work with some people, especially people who are not really paying
attention to what they're saying, but for most people, they can see right
through it. Basically, they're saying, "You're just throwing me a bone.
You're just trying to pacify me. You're not really listening. You're may be
distracted, but it is kind of patronizing for you to just summarize or bounce
back a tiny fraction of what I just said."

That's how you know somebody's trying to fake you out. When somebody
is really listening, they will summarize what you're saying in a neat, tidy
little package. Smart people are able to do this, but you don't necessarily
have to have an IQ north of 130 to pull this off. You just need to pay
attention, because regardless of whether you are good with words, or you're
a great improvisational speaker, and can summarize otherwise complicated
thoughts very quickly, you can work with the person you're talking to until
they get the idea that you understand them.

Saying that you're not good with words, or you're not all that eloquent or
articulate, is a copout. Being in that present moment, send the right signal.

Let the spotlight shine on them

I know, at this point, when you're talking to that hot blonde that you have
had your eye on since you entered the bar, you probably are under a
tremendous amount of pressure to tell her about your job. You're probably
thinking that, "Now is the time for me to talk about my car, or how much
money I have, or how many times I go to the gym."

Here's the best piece of advice I can share with you when you get that urge:
shut the hell up. Seriously, just shut up. Whatever you have to say is not
really going to add much to the conversation, because if you insist on
grabbing that spotlight and shining it on you, she is probably going to take
the wrong way. Remember, women like to be adored.

I don't care if you're talking to a Goth girl. I don't care if you're talking to a
chick who never dated in high school and was the class nerd. I don't care if
you are talking to some sort of parochial school virgin. All women want to
be treasured and cherished, they want attention. And if you butt into this
precious opportunity for her to savor the attention that she desires and
craves, who do you think will look like the bad guy? Because at the end of
the day, there will always be opportunities for you to talk about your car,
how many times you go to the gym, and everything else that's important to
you.

Right now, she must be the princes of your eye. Make her feel like she is
the center of the world, and that there is no other woman within a hundred-
mile radius except her. Otherwise, you're doing it wrong. Whatever good
impression you've built up to this point, just went up in smoke because you
rained on her parade.

## Chapter 13 : Master the art of likability

Likability is actually composed of many different strategies. I'm going to
break down some of the most common strategies for likability, but in reality
the list is quite long. Depending on who you're with, and depending on how
experienced they are, you might have to come up with something more
exotic. Still, if you are dealing with a woman who is fairly average, or
slightly above average, the following list should do.

People like others who are like them

As I have mentioned in an earlier chapter, we tend to be more comfortable
with people who look, talk, sound, and act like us. This is due to selective
evolutionary preferences. As I have mentioned already in a previous
chapter, if your caveman ancestors did not have a problem hanging out with
all other types of human beings, regardless of how unfamiliar or different
they are, that ancestor probably would've died off a long time ago. Those
genes did not make it. Instead the genes most human beings have were
passed on by people who gained survival advantage because they hung out
with people or similar enough to them.

Use this evolutionary fact to your advantage. Try to mirror the female
whom you are trying to impress. If she uses certain words, try to use those
words from time to time. Don't be obvious about it. If she has certain
gestures, try to mirror some of that, but again, don't give yourself away. The
reason you're doing this is, of course, to make her feel comfortable.

You want her to feel that you are somewhat familiar. She doesn't have to
have her guard up. She can give you the benefit of the doubt.

A little bit of reciprocity goes a long way

A lot of people are under the impression that reciprocity techniques
necessarily have to involve tokens, or gifts. I beg to differ. When you
compliment somebody, that is a gift. You don't need to compliment people.

In certain parts of the United States, particularly the East Coast, people
don't really go either way to compliment people. Compliments there are
usually earned.

It's a completely different ball of wax on the West Coast. In California, it
seems like everybody's trying out trying to outdo each other in terms of
pleasantries. So it does rub off as little bit fake, especially if you come from
the East Coast. Regardless, when you are nice to people with compliments,
as well as your observations about them, they feel like you're doing them a
favor. They feel that you are being nice to them, you're giving them a verbal
token.

Well, they will reciprocate, not necessarily with a compliment, but they may
feel more comfortable around you. Maybe that's that the best way they can
reciprocate. Whatever the case may be, understand that a little bit of
reciprocity can go a long way.

Ask open ended questions and remember their responses and come back to
them

When you ask open-ended questions, you let the person tell a story. You let
the person fill in the details, and they are less likely to feel defensive. They
feel that they have a free range as to what they can talk about. Compare this
with a series of yes or no answers. It would easily appear to them that you
are somehow interrogating them. Not exactly sexy, right?

What makes this technique work, in terms of likability, is what you choose
to do with the information you get with your open-ended questions. The key
here is to remember their responses, and then refer back to them later in the
conversation. When you do that, you say, in no uncertain terms, and in the
clearest way possible, that she is important enough to you for you to
remember certain details about her life.

Let me tell you, too many women are insecure. Too many women suffer
from low self-esteem. Too many women have daddy issues. Whatever the
case may be, there is some sort of insecurity there, and guess what? All of
us have insecurity. But when you do this and refer back to earlier in your

conversation or to her earlier story, you let her know that she is worthy. She
is important enough, she is interesting enough.

When somebody is struggling with feeling like a nobody, or feeling like
there's something wrong with her, or there's something missing in her life,
how do you think she would react to you? It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out the answer. You're going to stand out from the crowd, because
a lot of these women project their insecurities and low self-esteem onto
guys.

Basically, at the back of her head, she's thinking, "Well this guy is cute and
everything, but he's probably just one of them." When you show her,
through this technique, that she is important enough to you, you become
instantly more likable.

Summarize what they have said and ask them about their opinion

When you talk to somebody, a lot of information will go both ways. If
you're a great conversation, you try to massage it in such a way that it
usually goes one way. But don't rest on your hands. Don't think that you
have dodged all responsibility for the conversation.

Sure, she's doing most of the talking, but that doesn't mean that you should
just sit back and just take it all in, and expect to coast through the
conversation; it doesn't work that way. You have to summarize what they've
said, and then ask them about their opinion at certain points.

If you think she feels good because you remembered her responses, wait
until you ask her for her opinion based on the things that she raised. She
feels like she has drawn you into her world, she feels that you really care
about her world. Now, you have to be sincere about this. You can't come off
as fake.

A lot of guys try to do this, and they end up overdoing it because they're
trying to basically have sex with the chick that they're talking to. You can't
be obvious. You have to be truly interested in what they have to say. You
have to be sincere about seeking their opinion.

Compliment them by triangulating

I remember the first time I said, "You're beautiful" to this really exotic-
looking Asian woman. Guess what happened? I turned her off, it was too
obvious. She liked the compliment, but it came off awkward. It was too
strong. It came too soon.

There's a big difference between looking deep into a woman's eyes when
you're in bed with her, and telling her she's beautiful, intoxicated in her
charm and clothed in her hair in the heat of passion, and sitting at a dining
table and looking at her trying to score points. See the disconnect? If you
are going to compliment a woman in a flirty way, don't do it directly,
seriously.

Don't freak them out by directly complimenting them. Make them praise
themselves by putting words in their mouth. Let them eat them to it with
your question, and then let it sink in, but make it clear that you nudged them
into the conclusion. That's how you make it look natural. It comes off more
sincere that way.

Sure, you may have told her she looks beautiful, and you really mean it
100%, but it doesn't really matter what you're feeling. Perception is reality,
and if she thinks that you're looking like some sort of cheesy jerk, that's
who you are for that moment until you can redeem yourself. So don't do
that. Don't go for the direct approach; triangulate.

## Chapter 14 : Believe it or not, women are scared

## of you as you are of them

If you still have butterflies in your stomach, and every time you go on the
dance floor, it seems like you have two left feet, I've got some good news
for you. Please understand that as freaked out as you may be about
members of the opposite sex, they have it worse than you. In fact, they have
it doubly worse. What am I talking about? Women are as scared of you as
you are of them.

In fact, in many cases, women are more scared of you than you are of them.
So don't let the fact that you may blow it throw you off. Think of it this
way: if you come across a very good-looking woman, don't let that fact put
you in a serious strategic disadvantage. When you look at a woman and all
you can think about is how hot she is, you are really sabotaging yourself.

You won't be able to flirt successfully with her, because all you can think
about how you're going to blow it. All you can think about is what can go
wrong because you're so scared about blowing your chance. You have to
remember guys trigger all sorts of self-fulfilling prophecies when they talk
to women. It is really quite sad.

Obviously, they don't want to lose the chick. They don't want to give a bad
impression. They don't want to look like a clown, but that's exactly what
happens, because they're so afraid. They're so paralyzed by the prospect of
losing her attention and her affection. Stop being scared.

You have nothing to lose

What exactly do you have to lose if that hot blonde from Norway blows you
off? What exactly have you lost when that amazing Italian-looking chick
gives you the cold shoulder? How less of a man would you feel when that
beautiful, exotic Filipina laughs you off? Here's the secret and the answer:
nothing.

You came in with nothing, and after that incident, you have nothing. So
what exactly have you lost? If anything, you've gained something. You may
be rolling your eyes, you might even be chuckling. Am I out of my mind?
Well, think about it this way; before you stepped up to her, all you had was
just the possibility, this aching desire that someway you could talk to her.
Well, you did talk to her. You stepped up to her, you took a shot.

That is a victory in of itself, because prior to that point, you were insecure.
You were second-guessing yourself, but against your normal inclination,
you stepped up and took care of the situation by engaging with that hot
female. It doesn't really matter whether it went south or not. What's
important is you found the nerve, the willpower, and the focus to man the
hell up.

That's a victory. That's nothing to be embarrassed about, that's nothing to be
ashamed of. If anything, it is to be celebrated. So do yourself a big favor,
step out of the shadow of your fear of women, because they are as scared of
you as you are of them. In fact, in many cases, they're more scared of you,
and the rejection you bring to the table than you are of them.

In many cases, this is a situation where two scared people are going to meet
face-to-face. Instead of letting it devolve into fear, which can manifest into
an awkward exchange, nervous silences, and getting off on the wrong foot,
just let go of the fear. Instead, grab hold of curiosity.

Be curious about that hot-looking Persian woman you're going to talk to.
Maybe she has a lot of amazing stories about Persian culture. That's a great
thing, right? At the very least, you could talk about food, interesting
cuisine, amazing travels. The more you hang on to fear, and you let fear
hang over your conversation or what you're about to do, you're just going to
be sabotaging yourself. Seriously, you're stepping forward on the wrong
foot.

Shift your focus from fear to curiosity, or to optimism. Whatever you need
to do, step out of your fear, it leads nowhere. It's a dead end.

## Chapter 15 : Learn to override your introverted

## nature

This chapter is optional. Obviously, it is intended only for introverts. If
you're an introvert, and I know a lot of introverts, listen up. You are a social
person at some level or another. I know that's a shock to you, because you
probably don't imagine yourself being one, but you are. If you like to talk to
people, if you have a few close friends, or if you have had girlfriends in the
past, you are social enough. That's good enough.

The key here is to understand that being shy and being introverted are two
totally different things. A shy person is somebody who just doesn't like to
be around crowds because they have a negative association with crowds.
Maybe they had a traumatic experience in the past. Maybe, they got bullied
in front of a crowd. Maybe they just have bad experiences with a series of
strangers. Whatever the case may be, they have negative associations, and
that's why people throw them off.

If you get them in a room with a few other people, and it's an intimate
setting, they will develop friendships. They are more likely to reach out and
become social in that context. Everybody has at least some sort of social
ability locked within them. This is a completely different picture from an
introvert.

An introvert can be a very social person with their friends, close family
members, etc. However, when you put them in any kind of social situation,
they feel tired sooner rather than later. I'm not talking about being
physically tired, I'm talking about mentally and emotionally tired. You have
to understand that introverts burn up a lot of energy when they're trying to
be social in an open or a large group setting.

Extroverts, on the other hand, feed off that kind of thing. As the night goes
on, extroverts become more energized. Introverts work the opposite way.

As the night goes on, the night drags because their social energy level drops
off like a rock. You see how this works?

So if you are an introvert, understand that you only have so much willpower
to work with in a social setting. There's nothing wrong with this, this is how
you're wired. What's important is you understand how you are wired so you
can be fully prepared. You have to have a contingency plan. You know that
you tend to feel tired as time goes on, as you try to socialize.

Do yourself a big favor and schedule breaks where you can be alone, so you
can recharge your social and emotional batteries. Do what you need to do
override your introverted nature. This doesn't mean that you're flawed. This
doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you. This is just who you
are.

So the key here is to reshape, or adapt your social interactions so as to work
with your introvert nature instead of against it. A lot of introverts suffer
from really bad social contacts and bad experiences because they are trying
to fit a square peg in a round hole. They don't understand their introverted
nature, and a lot of them feel that they have to apologize for it. A lot of
them feel that they're basically defective or there's something wrong with
them.

All that negativity is going to seep through at some level or another; don't
do it. Instead, change your frame of reference. Understand that you are an
introvert, and that's perfectly fine. You just have to be adequately prepared
so you can remain socially energized as you flirt with women.

## Chapter 16 : Learn to “Dance Conversationally”

## with Your Conversation Partner

A lot of guys are very rigid when it comes to talking with members of the
opposite sex. They really are. It's as if they are working off some sort of
script. In fact, a lot of guys are so clumsy and awkward that it seems like
they’re just going through the motions. If it were up to them, they’d
dispense with conversation altogether and just get down to sex or business
or whatever it is they had in mind.

The problem with this type of strategy, if you even want to call it that’ is
that it really flies in the face of effective interpersonal interaction. As I have
a mentioned several times in this book, if you want to be successful with
other people, you have to give them what they want.

If you ask any successful salesman the secret to their success, if you boil
down all the mumble-jumbo that they give you, it really all comes down to
giving people what they want so you can get what you want. It's a win-win
situation.

You have to understand that if you're talking to this really hot woman, she’s
not going to give you the time of day unless she can gain sort of certainty
that you will give her what she's looking for. She's looking for great
conversation, which I have defined earlier. Great conversation, as far as
most people are concerned, means they get to talk about themselves. That's
the bottom line.

Unfortunately, a lot of guys just completely blow through this. They know
what they should be doing. They’ve been around the block a few times but
they can’t help themselves. It's as if you take a kid and you tell a kid not to
pick up candy from the shelf as you go through the grocery store but he
does it anyway.

You must have some level of self-discipline for you to pull this off. This is
extremely important especially here in Chapter 16. In this chapter, I’m
going to walk you through a fairly advanced technique.

You have to understand that your main goal is not to go to bed with the
female you're talking to. That would be a nice side benefit, but that should
not be your main goal. Similarly, your main mission should not be to get
into a multimillion-dollar deal with that person.

Again, that would be great if it happened. However, as far as conversation
skills are concerned and as far as effective flirting goes, you have to make
her comfortable. That's the bottom line.

Here is the secret. For you to make other people comfortable, you must first
be comfortable with yourself. As the old saying goes, “You can only give
what you have.” It's hard to love other people if you can't love yourself. It's
hard to respect other people when you don't even have respect for yourself.

Do you see how this works? Do you see the internal logic? Good! I wanted
you to wrap your mind around the concept of reciprocity because this lays
the framework or foundation for what I’m about to teach you in this
chapter.

Dancing Conversationally

Have you ever noticed that really effective salespeople are able to
schmooze with a variety of customers? It doesn’t matter what these clients
look like. It doesn’t matter which part of the world they come from. It
doesn’t matter how much money or how little money they have. It doesn't
matter what kind of experiences they bring to the table. These master
salespeople are just able to talk to all people all the time anywhere. Mind-
blowing, right?

When you pay attention to the rhythm of the conversation, there are a lot of
pauses; there are some segues; but there is an overall flow. You may be
thinking that this is magic. You may be thinking that this is just way beyond
your pay grade and there’s really no way you can get this.

Unfortunately, if you believe that, chances are you will fail. If you believe
that, then you basically just sabotaged yourself and you might as well throw
in the towel because you won't be able to do it.

However, if you open your mind to the fact that there is something fun
going on and since it's fun, you too can learn it. What am I talking about?
When people talk to others and they have managed a certain level of mutual
they're actually “dancing.”

Obviously, they’re not doing the tango. They’re definitely not doing the
Macarena, but they’re dancing verbally. It's as if you're hanging out with a
really good friend and, in many cases, your friend would complete your
thought. In fact, you’re no longer surprised that your friend would complete
your sentence right as you were thinking it.

This may be due to the fact that you've been friends for a long time but,
believe it or not, even if you have just met somebody and you really got
into a rhythm with them, and you can totally flow with what they're saying
and all the non-verbal and verbal signals line up, you start to dance. You
start to anticipate each other. You start to look at the whole flow of ideas
and information as something engaging, fun, fulfilling, and inspiring.

In other words, you create an upward spiral and this must first begin with
comfort. You have to be comfortable. You may be thinking to yourself,
“Well, I've always had a tough time talking to women, much less flirting
with them. How can I be comfortable?”

Well, you're going to have to find a way. The first way to do it is to be
familiar enough with your surroundings. If you keep going to a dance club
or some sort of singles bar or local bar restaurant, you really have no
excuse. Seriously. No joke. If you've been there before, then it's your
responsibility to look around, get your bearings, and somehow get a
physical orientation for the place.

One of the best ways to become comfortable in any kind of public setting is
to visit that place. That way, it feels somewhat familiar. You’re no longer

operating without strings, so to speak. It's not like somebody just dropped
you right in the middle of enemy territory and got the hell out of there. It's
not like you’re on your own.

You've been there before. You know what to expect. You have a fairly
general understanding of the kind of people who would hang out there and
the type of social situations you will find yourself in. In other words, it’s not
alien territory. It’s not a completely new experience. Allow yourself to be
comfortable based on familiarity.

Second, coming in prepared mentally and emotionally goes a long way. You
know the name of the game is to feel comfortable. Once you get women to
feel comfortable around you, they are more likely to open up and you're
more likely to create a rapport with them.

However, none of this is possible if you, yourself, are visibly
uncomfortable. Let me tell you, you can fake it until you make it. You can
simulate some sort of external confidence but, deep down inside, you are a
quivering piece of jelly.

I understand that. I’ve been there. Most guys have been there. But you can
only play that game for so long. Eventually, you're going to have to build it
on the solid foundation of internal comfort.

It's really important to come in mentally prepared. One of the best ways to
mentally prepare for any kind of social situation with members of the
opposite sex is that you have to realize that you are worthy. You're not a
complete and total fuck-up. You're not worthless. You're not a loser.

It doesn’t matter what other people say. It doesn’t matter what you feel from
time to time. What's important is that you know that, at some level or other,
you are competent enough. After all, you're still alive. You have a roof over
your head. You're not exactly broke and living on the street and begging for
money because your life depended on it. Do you see how this works?

So, count your blessings; come in with a sense of gratitude and openness
and, most importantly, look at it as an adventure. That’s the bottom line

because guys go into this situation looking to conquer. I understand that.
That’s the old hunter mentality that's just hardwired into guys’ DNA.

The problem is if you go in with that approach, you're going to be
surrounded by many other hunters. It quickly becomes a race to the bottom.
It becomes a dog-eat-dog, highly competitive and oppressive environment.

How do you think you'll do? Not too well because if you think you’re good,
there's somebody out there ten times better and behind him is another guy
who is a hundred times better. Competition, at that level at least, always
leads to the bottom.

Do yourself a big favor. Just come in with an open mind with a sense of
adventure. In other words, you’re looking to learn. You're looking to meet
interesting new people.

You’re not really looking to get laid per se, although that would be nice.
You’re not really looking for Ms. Right. Don't put that kind of pressure on
yourself. Just be there in the present moment to have a good time and this is
the key.

How do you define a good time? A good time is not you being the star of
the show. A good time is not you leaving the club with the hottest woman
hanging off your arm ready to have sex at her place. A good time is not
about you being some sort of Don Juan or playboy.

No. Having a good time means learning something new, being out and
about, and just enjoying yourself with other people who are enjoying
themselves.

When you define your objectives that way, you do two things. You relieve a
tremendous amount of pressure and you pave the way for a deep and
abiding level of inner comfort. This is the key. Get that internal comfort
going and then you would be able to dance conversationally with the
females you meet.

The Essence of Dancing Conversationally with a Stranger

Assuming that you're going to be meeting strangers, the key here is to
remember key details of your conversation. Remember, you’re not trying to
freak them out. You're not trying to psychoanalyze women. You're not
trying to comfort them regarding some sort of psych wound or deficiency
that they feel. If you were to do that, let me tell you, you’re going to be
opening a Pandora ’s Box.

A lot of guys try to play that game but they don't really know what they're
stepping into. It would be great if you talk to a woman who psychologically
got it together. Unfortunately, a significant number of women have issues
just like men.

If you think you have issues with your father who may have abandoned you
physically or emotionally, what do you think women feel? If you have
issues with your mom who may be controlling or have domineering issues,
what do you think women feel? If you think you have problems with your
ex because you have a tough time letting go of some of the things that
happened in the past, what makes you think it’s any different with females?

If you try to go that route, get ready for the kind of emotional turbulence
that you, yourself, might get dragged into. A lot of guys try to play that
game because they're trying to get into the head of the women. They think it
gives them a tremendous advantage, but little do they know that they may
be positioning themselves as the bad guy.

You have to understand that women, just like men, are always looking for
an excuse. If you position yourself as some sort of emotional rescuer and
for whatever reason things fall flat, who do you think will be blamed?
People hate blaming themselves so you know exactly who will be blamed.

I suggest that you do not even consider that route. That's off-limits to you.
Instead, focus on remembering superficial stuff that she says and then come
back to it as a frame of reference while you’re sharing certain things or
asking other questions.

This is how you dance because dancing is all about having a frame of
reference as far as moves that you're making. When she puts her left foot
forward, you move your feet a certain way and on and on it goes. Instead of
moving your body, you reference things in your conversation.

You have to do this smoothly. It can’t look forced. It can’t look like you
have an agenda. You must not come off as somebody who's trying to
memorize her just for the sake of memorizing her because, let’s get real
here, you just met her. If you were to do that, you’d look very creepy.

There's a fine line between a woman feeling like she matters because you
remembered stuff about her and her thinking that you're some sort of
control freak because you’re cataloging all the things that she's saying.
Maybe she would think that you would hold this against here. Do you see
how this works?

So, you can’t overplay this. The key is to be comfortable and get her to feel
comfortable and then you can dance conversationally just by referencing
stuff that you have talked about.

It's also a good idea not to insert yourself too much in the conversation.
When you're dancing on the dance floor, you're going to end up stepping on
your dance tens partner’s feet when you are too assertive. Basically, you’re
trying to hog the dance floor. It's not like your John Travolta in Saturday
Night Fever where your partner just goes off to the side and you put on a
show for everybody. No.

Dance is exactly that. It involves two people. It involves communicating
with your body in a soft, easy, and gentle way where everything is natural.

The same applies with verbal dancing. It has to be smooth and nothing is
rougher when you basically say, “No! This is me. This is what I think” or
“You can’t do that!” You've dropped the ball at that point. That's not
dancing. That’s more like kicking.

Do yourself a big favor and allow yourself to be in the present moment. If
she takes a detour and starts talking about other things, go with it. The key

is to make her comfortable while you, yourself, are feeling comfortable.

Always remember that you’re not out to get something. You’re not out to
get her number. You're not out to get into her pants. You’re not out to take
her back to your place or any of that.

Once you take that burden off your back, you become more comfortable.
This is no longer an ordeal nor does it feel like some sort of job. Do you see
how this works?

Focus on internal comfort by learning how to dance conversationally. This
is something that you have to play by ear because, remember, she will send
verbal and non-verbal signals just like you. You're going to have to figure
these out and then pass it back to her in the form of a reference so
everything flows smoothly.

## Chapter 17 : Learn How to Make Her Laugh

A lot of people think that funny guys have some sort of laundry list of
jokes. It's as if they’re walking and talking joke encyclopedias. It's not like
these guys have this massive list in their heads of which joke to say, at what
time and with which type of woman.

Let me tell you, unless you’re dealing with some sort of super genius, that
approach to comedy is just going to be too difficult. Seriously. Why?

Every crowd of people you come across is different. A joke may work well
with a certain group of people but when you take some people out of that
group and you add other people, the group dynamic changes. Jokes and
humorous situations and stories that killed the crowd before may fall flat on
its face just because the crowd changed.

There is such a thing as group dynamics and this is how you can tell a great
comedian from a hack. A hack basically just has this laundry list of joke
formulas in his head. Regardless of the crowd, regardless of time, and
definitely regardless of the place, he'll stick to the script.

Great comedians know how to feel out the crowd, and they if they feel that
the crowd vibe isn't there for a certain type of joke, then they'd have a
backup joke. That's how these comedians skill each and every time. They
crush it like clockwork.

Hacks, on the other hand, couldn't joke their way out of a wet paper bag
because they're too formulaic. They simply are too rigid, given the fluidity
of group social dynamics.

I share this with you because making a woman laugh also involves social
dynamics. Sure, the crowd that you are catering to consists of only one
person, but the same dynamics apply. You can have a funny joke that works
well with blonde-haired, blue-eyed sorority girls from the American
Midwest or the English Midlands, but if you were to try that on a hot

Filipina from Manila who speaks fluent English and has a graduate degree,
the joke might fall flat. Do you see how this works?

Instead of looking at humor in strictly formulaic terms, focus on the present
moment. In other words, the humor is purely situational, and it has to be a
product of your conversation with the woman as it plays out.

Why should You Make Her Laugh Anyway?

Before I go into some techniques that have enabled me to get women to
laugh, let me clue you in why this is worth doing. Laughter is nothing short
of magical. It really is. If you think about it, human beings are the only
animals on this planet who laugh.

Hyenas are called “laughing hyenas” but, let me tell you, that’s just the
sound they make. They’re not laughing. There's nothing humorous about
the things that they are “laughing” about. Usually, when you hear that
laughing sound from a hyena, either she's getting ready to go and run away
from you or you're about to get messed up. It's not a good sign.

Human beings can laugh and the more you laugh, the better it is for you. It's
been shown through several scientific studies that a healthy sense of humor
can lead to better overall health prospects. Regardless of the type of
personality you have, there's something out there that can make you laugh.

The bottom line is when people laugh, they drop their guard. They’re not as
defensive. You're not this unknown quantity that they want to get away
from. Since you made them laugh, you automatically made them more
comfortable. That's exactly what you want to happen because, ultimately,
when people get comfortable enough around you, they are more likely to
trust you. This is extremely important when it comes to bonding with
females.

Again, it doesn’t really matter whether your objective is to get her number
or get her to go home with you that night. What's important is that you are
comfortable enough with each other so your link rises above that of two
strangers.

Laughter is one effective tool that makes this happen. It’s all about getting
her to laugh. Let her drop her guard. Let her be comfortable and guess
what? The more visibly comfortable she is, the more confident you become.
See how this works? You create an upward spiral and, oftentimes, all it
takes is to getting her to laugh.

Make Sure You Make Her Laugh with You, Not at You

This should be fairly straightforward. Obviously, you don't want to get
women to laugh at you because you may be an object of ridicule. You might
be thinking that you’re a sad, pathetic, essentially unloveable, but the funny
thing about that idea of making people laugh with you instead of at you is
that in practical terms, it's not as clear-cut.

Let me tell you about my friend Rudy. Rudy came from Central America
and he has a very thick Latin accent even though he has lived in England
for a few decades. Obviously, Rudy hung onto his accent for purely social
reasons. It makes him distinctive. The average Brit you come across doesn’t
have a thick Latin accent. This makes him exotic in the eyes of many
English and European women.

Rudy is also distinctive in another key way. He always tries to get the
woman to laugh at him, and the way he pulls it off is nothing short of
amazing. It's like watching Rembrandt execute a painting. You just didn't
see it coming. He would sometimes intentionally slip in front of a woman
or he would look really clumsy and then when she laughs, he would have
this look in his eyes like he was some sort of wounded lamb.

He was operating on different levels that the woman who he's trying to get
with is playing checkers, but Rudy, it turns out, is always playing not just
chess. That's too simple. He’s playing eight-dimensional chess.

He has this mix of sympathy and smoldering Latin sexuality all in the same
package and to this day, I’m just mesmerized by how smoothly he pulls it
off and it all begins with him acting like some sort of clown. I’ve known
him for many years and I know that he is fairly agile. He’s not clumsy at all.

However, when he notices a really hot woman who he wants to get to know,
he becomes clumsy all of a sudden and then he even plays this trick where
he stutters from time to time. That's fake. It really blows my mind how he’s
able to pull it off.

I raise Rudy’s story at this point to let you know that even if you slip up and
the conversation involves her laughing at you instead of with you, that all is
not lost. You can still play it off. The key is to show vulnerability.

One of the most powerful ways you get people to like you is when you
make it a subtle point that you too have your flaws just like them. When
people stumble in front of a group of people, that's an opportunity for
laughter because when you do that, everybody is basically operating from
the same level. You're not flawless, perfect, or god-like. You’re just like
everybody else. When you show this glimpse of your humanity, people can't
help but look at you as somebody they can relate to. They feel that they can
identify with you.

The same applies to women. If you are trying to make a joke or you’re just
trying to talk to somebody and, for whatever reason something awkward
happens, play it off. That can be a great starting point for a humorous
conversation.

I remember a friend of mine, Jim, an Italian guy had a pack of cigarettes in
his front pocket and he forgot that he left a condom package next to the
cigarette and the package stuck to the outside of the cigarette box when he
whipped it out to give the hot female he was talking a smoke.

She asked for a cigarette and Jim took out his pack and the condom fell out.
Instead of being red-faced and thinking that this was the end of the world,
Jim played it off like a master and he said to her in a dead-pan style,
“Nobody can ever accuse me of being unprepared. Whether you want to
smoke or a different kind of smoke, I’m here for you” and she was just
laughing.

That's how you play the game because you have to be ready for
imperfection, miss execution, or suboptimal performance. Nobody is
immune to this. You think you’ve become prepared but sometimes you will
slip out.

I raise this point here at this section of the book so you can look at those
slip-ups as a segue to a joke. Look vulnerable. “Hey, the joke’s on me!” and
then you could crack jokes. You can make observational comments and
then base the humor from there.

This is how a lot of guys play it off and it's so awesome because it not only
makes you look more vulnerable and human, it also highlights your fast
thinking. You have to understand that women are evaluating guys at a speed
of a thousand miles per hour. Every word that you say, every mannerism,
they feel it.

A lot of women can’t verbalize it. A lot of women can’t articulate how
they’re judging you, but it’s happening. You just have to flow with it, and
this is a key part of learning how to make her laugh.

I wish there is some sort of decoder book that I can give you that would
quickly correlate one faux pas to a humorous opportunity, but no such code
book exists. This is something that you have to perfect on your own. You’ll
only get better at this the more you try it.

A lot of guys shy away from this because they don't like making “fools” out
of themselves. Well, you know what? You’re already making a fool out of
yourself. If you are very rigid and humorless, something that could have
been funny, vulnerable, and all-too-human becomes just a flat-out
embarrassment. Do yourself a big favor, mine these moments.

Learn the Art of Observational Comedy

I suggest that you check out do a search on YouTube for famous comedians
like Robin Williams, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, the list goes on and on.
There are tons of them. It doesn’t matter which comedian you start with,
just keep going through as many comedians as you can.

I need you to pay attention to how they observe certain things and how they
can make it funny. Usually, they would observe something that's true and
then blow with up into its most ridiculous, exaggerated form and that's
where the humor comes from.

For example, when you Louis CK was talking about being a middle-aged
man and being offered marijuana or cannabis. The last time he smoked
apparently was in the 1970s and back then, the weed was very, very weak.

Fast forward to today and he expressed his surprise that modern marijuana
is a biotechnology miracle crop. It has becomes so potent and told the story
of being offered by some young adults after a gig to try some weed.

He thought it was 1970s marijuana so he smoked pretty much half the joint
and the kids were telling him, “Dude, don't do that!” and, sure enough, he
was beginning to freak out and he told the story of how he was trying to
look normal and talk normal, but he was just blown away by paranoia
because he didn’t want those kids to think he was some sort of freak.

Observational comedy can make any kind of experience funny as long as
you know how to zero in on something factual and then relate it to
something exaggerated. Obviously, people don't freak out as dramatically as
Louis CK when they smoke weed, but that's what made it funny because
people can relate. There are kernels of truth that he is just blows up for
comedic effect.

You can do the same. When you’re talking to a woman and she says
something that she thinks it's funny and she chuckles at it, then you can
exaggerate it a bit and then laugh with her. She will then take your lead and
then exaggerate it further and laugh at that. You can then throw in a self-
deprecating humor from time to time room but don’t overdo it. That's how
you dance conversationally using humor. That's how you establish comfort.

Also, you can say certain things that happened in your past, relate it to what
she finds funny about her experiences. This is how you bounce back and
forth. It’s like ping-pong. The more you make her laugh, the more she

makes you laugh, and you become more and more comfortable with each
other. You have something special going on at that point.

Do Not Do This

Under any circumstances, do not do this. I’ve seen guys overdo the humor
angle so they end up laughing at the female when she tries to make a self-
deprecating joke. Remember, self-deprecating jokes are supposed to show
vulnerability. They’re intended to act as gateways for sympathy.

The problem is a lot of guys overdo it. It’s like they hammer the chick
they're talking to and they end up looking like they're laughing at her. What
do you think happens?

If you think you're insecure, wait until you meet certain women. Women are
just as insecure as men. The problem is when you feel like you're being
judged or your feel like you're being ridiculed, what do you think happens?
It's not good.

Don’t be surprised if your conversation becomes a chain of awkward
silences after this point. There is a point where you can laugh with her but
not too much. She's trying to do some self-deprecating humor but if you
overdo it, you trigger her insecurities.

How do you know the limit to this? Very simple. Pretend you’re her, and
I’m sure you can do that. Basically, pretend that you're her and what would
your limit be? How would you react if this hot female just basically starts
laughing like a donkey at something that you said that made you look
awkward, which you found fairly funny?

The key is that she has to laugh moderately. It has to be fairly funny.
However, if she reacts like it was the funniest thing in the world, then it's
very easy for your feelings to get hurt. You’re thinking in the back of your
head, “Maybe she’s laughing at me, not at the humor.”

If you are in doubt, get out of your body and put yourself in her shoes.
That's how you play the game. That way, you would use humor within its

safe confines and range. Otherwise, it can kill conversation.

I’ve seen happen many times. In fact, it’s happened to me a few times. It's
not pretty. You're having a good time. It seems like everything is going
well. This is especially true if you're talking to a really good-looking
woman and then all of a sudden, bam! You laughed too hard or you came
up with an exaggerated version that just hit too close to home.

You might want to feel her out verbally for quite some time so you can map
out the same parameters. Remember, the conversation is about her. You’re
there to please her. It’s not about you.

See you in Chapter 18.

## Chapter 18 : Pay careful attention to pacing

You have to get a feel for the flow of conversations. Just because you
reached the point where you’re both comfortable with each other, doesn’t
mean that you just have to drag out the conversation so you can get her
number.

In fact, in many cases, this is the worst thing you can do. How come? Well,
it looks like you’re dragging things out. It’s that obvious.

It can also backfire because the slow pace can lead to awkward silences.
You might feel like you’ve run out of things to talk about. You might even
reach a point where the conversational dancing that you’re doing as you’re
flirting ends up repetitive, formulaic, or even contrived.

Pacing is very important and it’s very situational. When you’re flirting with
somebody and you’re just exchanging small talk, you can’t go through the
motions. You can’t be too quick.

On the other hand, if you’re already talking to somebody, you can’t just
slow the conversation down because she also has a life to live. Maybe she
went to the club with her friends. Maybe you’re at work and she has to get
back to what she was doing.

You have to have quite a bit of situational awareness when it comes to
conversation pacing. Otherwise, it’s very easy to end up in a very awkward
conversation. What makes this really dangerous is it’s not obviously
awkward.

You might be having a great time. In fact, you may think that you’re doing
really well talking to this hot female, but as far as she is thinking, this is
taking too long. Maybe she’s just too polite to cut it off. Maybe she feels
like you’re a good guy and she doesn’t want to alienate you or turn you off,
but if it were up to her, she’d want to cut it short. Do you see how this
works?

A little bit of sensitivity goes a long way. Pay attention to the following
factors when it comes to pacing your conversations.

How in control you are of the conversation

When you’re in control of the conversation and it seems like you’re just
asking the questions and she’s just answering, you might want to wrap it up
and see if she tries to revive it. If that’s the case, then you can do some more
verbal dancing, but eventually you’re going to have to make her take the
lead.

The setting

Another key factor is the setting of the conversation. Are you at a dance
club? Are you at a camping trail? Are you at some sort of outdoor party or
are you at work? You have to understand that setting plays a big role in
pacing.

If you’re at work, you need to speed it up because both of you have to get
back to work. Maybe you’re just passing through the office. It wouldn’t
matter. She still has to get back to whatever she was doing.

This is why it’s really important to pay close attention to the pacing of your
conversation and have it lead to where you want it to go. You don’t have to
get her phone number right then and there.

You can say, “Well, I pass through here quite a bit. I’ll see you next time.”
Leave the door open. Think of this as the first step. Think of yourself as
laying the foundation for future contact. You don’t necessarily have to get
her number or ask her if you can follow her on Instagram or other social
media accounts.

Pay attention to context

If you met her because a friend of yours introduced her to you, you can
probably pace out the conversation more leisurely. You can take your time.

She was referred to you by a friend. You both have a mutual friend so
there’s that initial level of trust.

The understanding is your friend is not going to introduce you to some sort
of axe murdered or serial killer. There’s that level of trust there. You’re not
exactly an unknown quantity because you have a mutual acquaintance or
friend.

In that context, you can assume a more leisurely pace. You can use this to
your advantage. On the other hand, if you just met somebody at a bar, you
need to pay close attention to certain factors. Is she alone? Is she with just a
friend or are they in a group?

If they’re in a group, is the group in a hurry to get out of there? Maybe she’s
part of a bachelorette entourage and they’re doing bar hopping. If that’s the
case, then you need to step it up.

Tell her, “I don’t want to hold you because you guys are obviously going
from bar to bar, but can I get your number.” Here’s the thing. Do not be a
creep. What do I mean by that? Don’t offer to follow them as they go from
place to place. That is creepy, unless it’s her idea.

This has happened to me. If it’s her idea, that’s fine, but don’t propose it. It
will make you look like a stalker. It will make you look desperate and even
pathetic. Don’t do it. It’s very tempting especially if the female is extremely
hot, but a little bit of self-discipline goes a long way. In that context, ask for
her number. That’s the best you can do because her group is going to be
moving on.

On the other hand, if she’s alone, you can pace it out a little bit longer. She
obviously went to the bar because she’s looking for something. Again, this
is to your advantage.

If she’s with a friend, you have to have a way of playing off her friend.
You’re going to have to entertain the both of them because you don’t want
the friend to do what female friends normally do to their girlfriends. They
would yank her arm when she sees another guy.

If her friend sees a guy she’s interested in and she’d yank the arm of the
woman you’re talking to. You have to engage both of them. Now, I’m not
saying that you should go to bed with both of them. I’m saying that you
should entertain them so her friend doesn’t get distracted.

Ideally, you should be there with a wingman. That’s what wingmen are for.
They’re there to neutralize the “extra” friend.

Your prospects

I know you don’t want to hear this, but I’m going to say it anyway. Be
realistic about your prospects. If you’re flirting with a female and she’s not
bouncing any of your signals, but for whatever reason, she keeps talking to
you, you have to know when to cut it off.

I know this is an unpleasant topic because a lot of guys are under the
impression that every time they try, something has to materialize. It doesn’t
work that way. Seriously. Just because you swing a bat doesn’t mean that
it’s going to hit the ball and the ball is going to go over the fence.

I wish that was true, but it isn’t. It’s a numbers game if you think about it. A
lot of the times, the women that you talk to have something else going on or
they expect a different kind of guy. Maybe they just have other factors in
mind and sadly, you’re not going to make it.

It’s your job to look at your overall prospects. Is there any possibility that
this may lead to somewhere even close to where you want to go? Of course,
for the most part, you’re focusing on your natural curiosity. You just want to
know more about her and get her to tell a story or try to make her laugh.

However, if that mutual comfort doesn’t seem like it is materializing or you
noticed that you’re very comfortable, but she’s just barely comfortable,
maybe it’s a good idea to just cut it off. You have to understand that you
need to do this.

This is not optional. This is an absolute necessity. How come? There is such
a thing as an opportunity cost. Think about it. If you meet a woman that’s
really good looking and you really want to go home with her that night, you
start flirting with her for half an hour.

During that half hour, you noticed that you’re very comfortable, but it
seems like she’s kind of warmed up a little bit, but not enough to make
much of a difference. At that point, you really have a choice as far as the
rest of the night goes.

You can choose to drag this on until the bar closes. You definitely can do
that if for whatever reason, she’s not leaving you. However, you have to
understand that women stay there not because they like you.

A lot of women don’t really want to be there, but they don’t know what
they want so they’re basically just “parking” themselves in front of guys
who’s obviously interested in them. They still haven’t made up their mind
or worse yet, they really have no interest in you.

The problem is you lose out when this happens. She’s okay with her talking
to you for the rest of the night, but she’s not going to do anything with you
after the bar closes. You’re definitely not going to be taking her home or
getting her number.

Instead, you spend the rest of the time with her and worse yet, if you’re like
most guys, you’d probably buy her a drink or two. Not only is this costing
you time, but it’s also costing you money. Opportunity costs are real.

For all that time you spent with her, you could’ve been taking shots at other
women. Remember, it’s a numbers game. If you were just to focus on one
prospect and put all your chips on that bet, you’re out of luck. For whatever
reason, it’s not working out.

On the other hand, you could’ve pursued other women with the time and
resources you have. Sure, not all of them would click with you, but if you
try enough times, a few might. Think of it this way, would you rather lose

100% of the time because you took one shot or win while losing 99% of
your shots because you took 100 shots.

The choice should be obvious. Learn how to cut it off, but here’s the thing.
You have to make it smooth. Don’t just say, “I’m tired of talking to you.”
Instead, cut it off in a friendly way. Get to the friend zone.

This is one of those situations where the dreaded friend zone is actually a
good thing. Get to the friend zone. At the very least, you made a new friend.

If you did not hook up that night and it was obvious at that point that there
was no potential of hook up in the near future, that’s okay. Get in the friend
zone and then move on to the next woman because opportunity costs are
real. Don’t blow it.

## Chapter 19 : Remember that you’re not under

## pressure

A lot of guys who try to flirt with women do so under unnecessary pressure.
It’s not like there’s a crowd of people watching them. Still, they feel that
they’re performing in front of an audience. Well this is all an illusion. If
you’ve felt this, it’s because of the pressure you put on yourself.

Whatever pressure you’re feeling while you’re trying to flirt or send
positive signals to a woman you’re attracted to is self-inflicted. That’s right.
It’s all in your head. If you think about it and you look at the big picture,
nobody really cares.

What you’re doing has an impact on you and maybe the female that you’re
trying to talk to. Maybe she’d blow you off or give you the cold shoulder.
That’s that. In the big scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter.

What matters is when you actually hook up with a female. It may well turn
out that this woman that you’re trying to talk to simply isn’t interested. So
what? She’s not the first nor will she not be the last.

Unfortunately, a lot of guys miss the memo on this. They approach flirting
or hooking up like their depended on it. It’s as if they only have one shot
and this is it. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why this is
a bad idea.

When you operate with that assumption, you’re putting a ridiculous amount
of pressure on yourself and it’s not going to have a positive effect on your
performance.

It’s going to erode your self-confidence. You’re going to look desperate. For
whatever skills you may have and whatever progress you may have made in
flirting, it’s all going to fall apart.

Few people can withstand that kind of pressure. Don’t think that you’re up
for it. Sadly, that’s exactly the kind of pressure you put on yourself. You
really have nobody to blame except yourself when this happens. You
dropped the ball. It’s all on you.

Understand that it’s all a numbers game

When you have a big picture view of what you’re doing and you allow
yourself to just be curious, you have a higher chance of becoming
successful. You can see what you’re doing in the broader context of your
life.

Win or lose, this not going to make much of a difference, unless of course
she turns out to be a really good friend or Ms. Right, but outside of those
possibilities, she’s just another face unless you make her otherwise.

This is the trap guys keep stepping into. They think that they only have one
shot. They think that if they don’t make it this time, they’ve blown it for the
night.

I can’t even begin to tell you how many friends of mine unnecessarily
sabotage the rest of their night because they put all their hope in that first
attractive female they stepped up to. Experienced flirts know that this is a
dead-end strategy.

You can’t blow all that motivation, willpower, and focus on the first woman
or even the second, third, fourth, and fifth woman for that matter. You have
to play it like a numbers game. If she says no, fine. If she gives you the cold
shoulder or sends you negative signals, that’s fine as well. You let go and
you move on.

The problem is when you’re putting yourself under all this pressure, you
can’t let go. Somehow, someway, it is some sort of judgement against your
character for whatever reason you think that just because this female turned
you down that you have instantly become the Hunchback of Notra Dame.
Why is that?

You’re probably not the first guy she turned down. You’re probably not the
first guy who crashed and burned with her. Let me clue you in on a key
principle. It’s actually pretty straightforward. The more attractive the
female, the higher the number of guys she has turned down.

As the old saying goes, if you’re going to fail, fail big. To put it another
way, you either go big or go home. With that mindset, swing for the fences
and look for supermodel material. At the very least, if you get shot down,
you can draw some comfort from the fact that you are hardly alone.

If that female is really hot— and I’m talking about supermodel hot—
chances are there are thousands of guys who tried to do the same thing you
did and went nowhere. Don’t feel too bad. With this mindset, you’ll be able
to let go, move on, and try again.

This is not going to happen if you put all sorts of unnecessary pressure on
yourself. Just because she turns you down, doesn’t mean you’re ugly. Just
because she thinks you’re corny and your jokes are useless and not funny at
all doesn’t mean you’re an idiot.

Stop judging yourself. Understand that this is just part of the game. Even if
you initially connect and she becomes really comfortable around you, it is
no guarantee that the rest of the conversation and flirting process would
lead to where you need it to go. Understand that possibility and accept it.
Again, you need to let go and move on.

What’s important is you were able to be in the moment

I don’t want to sound cliché, but there’s a saying, “It’s okay to lose as long
as you don’t lose the lesson.” Let’s face it, not all of us can be winners all
the time. Not all out efforts produce the results we desire.

If you’re going to debate me on this, then you are living in fantasy land.
This is reality. We don’t live in a dream land. We live in an imperfect world
and let’s face it, not everything we do will produce success.

Similarly, if you want to go home with a hot female or get a beautiful
woman’s phone number, you’d probably have to step up to maybe five, ten,
twenty, or maybe a hundred women at that bar or dance club. That’s the
name of the game.

Just because you’re dealing with such odds doesn’t mean that you’re
somehow defective or there’s something wrong with you, or you have a
personality flaw. That’s just the way it is. A lot of it involves market
dynamics.

I don’t want to sound like an economist here, but if you think about it,
there’s quite a bit of economic theory going on when it comes to dating.
That hot girl that you have your eye on is in demand. There are many guys
trying to step up and get her attention. There are many guys trying to hook
up with her.

She is in a seller’s market. She can be as selective, picky, and let’s face it,
arbitrary as she wants. There are many situations where even if you’re the
best-looking guy in the world with a million dollars in the bank, you still
have no shot at that chick in the bar. Why?

Well, it turns out that there are many other guys who have a lot to offer
going after her. Dating is comparative. That’s why the “price” of selection
goes up depending on intensity of the demand and the scarcity of the
supply.

Can you imagine if she was the only hot female there? It doesn’t matter
how well you normally perform with ladies, your odds are going to be very
challenging indeed. It is all situational.

Now, if you were surrounded by guys who are out of shape and lack
confidence and smell and there are tons of good looking women in the bar,
your chances go up tremendously. In that particular market, you’d probably
be hooking up like you were shooting fish in a barrel. It would be that easy.
How come? The supply and demand curve has changed dramatically.

You have to look at both sides. You have to look at the supply and you also
have to look at the demand. If you’re facing a tremendous amount of
competition and there are very few good looking women in the room, you
have your work cut out for you.

I remember a friend of mine who went to graduate school in the University
of California system. He was telling me that dating in graduate school was
actually very tough. What made it tough was that the selection of females
there wasn’t really all that good.

Objectively speaking, the good looking women were few and far between.
You couldn’t tell based on how many of these otherwise homely and all-
too-plain women were dating. All these guys were falling over themselves
to ask out women who in normal circumstances, they wouldn’t even notice.

That’s the power of the supply and demand curve. When you have a lot of
guys and relatively few good looking women, the curve, so to speak, shifts
to the right. Women who would normally be considered flat-out ugly still
get a lot of dates. They still get to select a lot of guys in that context.

That was my friend’s experience. He said, “Man, it was really tough. For
me to get a date, I had to basically go to a bar in the San Francisco Bay area
because out there, the proportions were more normal.”

I share this with you because you have to develop a situational attitude
when flirting. It’s very easy for guys to blame themselves if their game isn’t
all that hot at a certain night. It’s very easy for them to say that maybe it’s
them— what they’re saying, their timing, their pacing, and on and on it
goes.

Well, you’re neglecting one important ingredient. The supply and demand
dynamics in that room may not be favorable to you. What do you do in that
situation? Well, here’s my advice. Choose to learn.

First of all, choose to see that that’s what’s going on. Choose to understand
that this is not your fault because you’re following my tips, you’re going

through the advice I offered earlier in this book, and you’re giving it your
best shot.

You’re not just thinking about it, hoping, and wishing. No, you’re actually
doing it. Pat yourself on the back. Just because it didn’t pan out this time
doesn’t mean that all this advice and preparation are a waste of time.

The third thing you should learn is the ability to lose graciously. Like I said,
we live in an unfair world. We live in a world that we didn’t create. It’s
messed up. It’s chaotic from time to time, but you shouldn’t let any of that
get in the way of you giving it your best shot and being cheerful about it.

In other words, keep your head up. Just because you didn’t win this time
doesn’t mean that you’re not going to win ever again. The math just didn’t
stack up your way this time. Well, it might favor you the next time.

What’s important is you found the willpower, focus, and dedication to step
up and flirt with woman after woman today. That is awesome. Let me tell
you, too many guys are more than happy to just sit back and blame
everybody else for why they are unable to pursue their dreams.

This of course, includes the ability to flirt and hook up with a wide range of
women. They never run out of excuses. They always have a steady stream
of candidates to blame for why things haven’t panned out.

You did not choose to do that. Instead, you got out there and you tried again
and again and again. Hats off to you. That is the most important lesson that
you would ever learn. Until and unless you learn that lesson, you’re going
to play the dating game out of fear.

I don’t know about you, but fear is a lousy motivator. Fear sucks it out of
you and eventually you’ll run dry. Instead, you allow your sense of
curiosity, adventure, and possibility lead you forward. That’s how you’ll
eventually win.

## Chapter 20 : Conclusion

If you want to become a great flirt, you really need to know how to read
your situation and truly be curious. It all boils down to establishing mutual
comfort. Unfortunately, a lot of guys have all sorts of misconceptions and
are laboring under serious misunderstandings of how the flirting game
works.

It is no surprise that the vast majority of guys who flirt are unsuccessful in
the long run. Sure, they get lucky from time to time, but it is too random
and takes too much emotional and mental resources.

The tips that I’ve shared with you in this book enable you to achieve a
higher and more predictable probability of success. Now, nothing is
ironclad. Nothing is guaranteed. All the information that I’ve shared with
you here requires effort and most importantly, fine-tuning.

Everybody’s different. Everybody has different experiences. We all come
from different backgrounds. All these differences do add up. This is why
this book is not positioned as some sort of magic bullet solution.

It’s not like I shared with you a secret set of dating mantras that you only
need to recite for magical things to happen. This is not Hogwarts Academy.
This is real life. In the real world of dating, you have to carry out these tips
and fine-tune them based on your set of circumstances.

At the end of the day, it all boils down to the attitude you bring. Your
attitude will determine how well you learn, how quickly you adapt, and
how successful you ultimately become. The good news is armed with the
right information, you should be confident that you will be able to pull this
off.

It takes quite a bit of practice, but it’s definitely worth it. Another thing to
feel good about is that the skills you learned from this book applies across

the board. I don’t care whether you’re looking for a better job, trying to get
paid more, or trying to get promoted.

These skills will help you. Whether you’re trying to do well in school or
trying to become a more persuasive person in general, I have laid out the
ground work that will help you get to where you want to go. Today is the
day for you to seize your dating future.

Stop sitting back and looking at your dating life like it’s some sort of movie
flashing in front of your eyes. All the wishing and hoping in the world is
not going to change your situation one bit.

Whether you’re looking for a relationship or you’re just looking to hook up
more frequently with women, I have given you the tools. Now is the time
for you to use them. I wish you nothing but the greatest success.
